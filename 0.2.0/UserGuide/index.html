<div class="title">MakerVR User Guide</div>

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE ./UserGuide/Overview.md   -->
<section class="section1"><h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>MakerVR helps you create models that you can then send to a 3D printer.
It is designed to be relatively simple to use, even for someone with little to
no 3D modeling experience. If you are intimidated by 3D modelers like Blender,
you might find MakerVR useful.</p>
<p>MakerVR is inspired somewhat by <a href="http://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> (my favorite
program for creating 3D models). OpenSCAD is great if you don't mind typing in
numbers for everything and have a reasonable amount of 3D graphics
experience. MakerVR is designed to have a similar amount of power while still
being useful to beginners.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>Typical use of MakerVR to create models for 3D printing involves the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create one or more models of different types or import existing models in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL format</a>.</li>
<li>Edit the models and/or combine them in different ways to create new models.</li>
<li>Export any of the resulting models to STL files to send to a 3D printer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because precision is extremely important when 3D printing, MakerVR has several
features that allow you to create models with exact dimensions, orientations,
and positions. See the section on <a href="#precision">precision</a> for details.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="the-work-area">The Work Area</h2>
<p><img alt="The (empty) MakerVR work area" src="img/WorkArea.jpg" /></p>
<p>The work area in MakerVR is based conceptually on a virtual workshop. You may
notice the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four walls, a floor, and a ceiling. They just provide scene context.</li>
<li>An exit sign. Clicking on this exits the application. If you haven't saved
  your session, you will be asked to do so.</li>
<li>A large disc in the middle of the floor with a grid on it. This is the
  <a href="#the-stage">stage</a> on which models are built.</li>
<li>A pole on the right with a ring around it. The ring is a <span class="term">height
  slider</span> that can be used to <a href="#viewing">change the view height</a>.</li>
<li>Several shelves with 3D icons on them. Each icon represents an
  <a href="#shelves-and-actions">action</a> that makes a change to the scene or program state.</li>
<li>A caliper to the right of the exit sign with text that shows the current
  <a href="#precision">precision level</a>, along with buttons to increase or decrease it.</li>
<li>A large framed panel on the right of the back wall. This is the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree
  Panel</a> that shows your models in tree form and provides various
  ways to interact with them.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2>
<p>Unlike applications that save your work as a data file, MakerVR stores your
<span class="term">session</span> as a series of commands that have been executed. This means
that you can save your session, quit, restart your session, and be back pretty
much where you were. You can undo all of your work back to the beginning if you
feel like it.</p>
<p>When you start the application, the first thing you see is the <a href="#session-panel">Session
Panel</a>. It offers you the chance to continue the current session
(if there is one), load a different session, or start a new session.  The
location of saved sessions is customizable in the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The state of various settings (such as whether <a href="#targets">targets</a> and

</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="coordinate-system-and-units">Coordinate System and Units</h2>
<p><img alt="The MakerVR coordinate system" src="img/CoordSys.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>MakerVR uses the same coordinate system that most 3D printing software uses:
right-handed, with +X to the right, +Y away from the viewer, and +Z up. The
surface of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a> is at Z=0.</p>
<p><span class="tiny">Don't let the fact that this application is built on Unity with its
ridiculous left-handed coordinate system bother you.</span></p>
<p>MakerVR is essentially unit-independent. The only places where units are
considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>When models are imported or exported from or to STL files.</li>
<li>When the 3D printer <a href="#the-build-volume">build volume</a> is shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a> allows you to specify <a href="#unit-conversion">how to convert
units</a> when importing and exporting, and also how large the
<a href="#the-build-volume">build volume</a> is in whatever units you would like to work in.</p>
<p>The application assumes by default that everything is expressed in centimeter
units. If your 3D printing software expects STL files in millimeter units, you
can convert from centimeters to millimeters on export. If you are importing an
STL file that is in millimeters, you can convert it from millimeters to
centimeters on import.</p>
<p>If you want for some reason to work in inches, you can just consider the
working units to be inches, and use the same conversion facilities to convert
to and from saner units.</p>
<p>Note that the grid on the stage has thin lines every 1 unit, with thicker lines
every 5 units. The grid grows or shrinks <a href="#the-stage">when the stage is scaled</a>
so that you can always measure absolute sizes of models. The X and Y axes are
colored red and green on the grid for reference.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="the-build-volume">The Build Volume</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/BuildVolume.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" /></p>
<p>If you want to make sure that your models will fit within your 3D printer's
build volume, you can choose to display the build volume on the stage by
clicking on the <a href="#build-volume-toggle">Build Volume Toggle</a> icon. The build volume
is rendered as a translucent box. You can specify the size of your build volume
in the <a href="#build-volume-size">Settings Panel</a>.</p>
<p>When the build volume is visible, parts of models that lie outside it are
rendered in <a href="#model-colors">a special color</a> to warn you of potential printing
errors.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>
<p>Most everything in the application that aligns with the coordinate axes uses
the standard RGB color scheme: X is <span style="color:red;">red</span>, Y is
<span style="color:green;">green</span>, Z is <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>, as shown
above. This is true for <a href="#tools">tool</a> parts, <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guides</a>, and

</section><section class="section1"><h1 id="interaction">Interaction</h1>
<p>While MakerVR is designed to be reasonably intuitive, there are a few things
that may need explanation before you can dive into using it.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR and Non-VR Modes</h2>
<p>MakerVR was originally designed to operate in a virtual environment because I
it seemed like it would be a fun experience. But, since most people do not have
a VR setup, I thought it might be useful if it also worked without VR, using
just a conventional mouse and keyboard setup. And, since putting on and taking
off a headset can be very inconvenient while developing an application
(especially if you happen to wear glasses), I thought it might be useful and
fun to allow using the VR controllers even without the headset. This turned out
to be possible!</p>
<p>Each of these modes is called out in this guide when interaction differs among
them. The modes are named as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">VR mode</span> is active when you have a VR device hooked up, you are
  wearing the headset, and are holding the controllers.</li>
<li>In <span class="term">conventional mode</span>, you either do not have a VR device hooked
  up or you do but you just want to use the mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li><span class="term">Hybrid mode</span> is halfway between the other two: you have a VR
  device hooked up, you do not have the headset on, and you have at least one
  VR controller in your hand(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some VR experiences allow you or force you to walk around while using them.
That wouldn't make sense for this application, so it is designed to make
everything useful from one spot. If you're planning to use the VR mode, set it
up for a comfortable, fixed standing or seated position. Note that the scene
view is set up for sitting, so you may need to adjust your VR positioning for a
different height if you prefer to stand.</p>
<p>MakerVR was developed using an HTC Vive (since that's what I have), but should
(!) work with any standard VR controllers supported by
<a href="https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/">SteamVR</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="clicking-and-dragging">Clicking and Dragging</h2>
<p>MakerVR responds to mouse and keyboard actions in any of the <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">three
modes</a>. Note that the left mouse button is used for all click and drag
actions; the right mouse button is used to <a href="#viewing">change the view
orientation</a>. Keyboard shortcuts are listed in the <a href="../CheatSheet">Cheat
Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>Controller use is as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="Controller feedback with laser pointer and hover
guide" src="img/ControllerVR.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The controllers appear in the VR scene as hands that react to interaction,
  courtesy of <a href="https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/">SteamVR</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cyan laser pointer emanates from the forward direction of each controller.
  the <span class="term">pinch</span> action (usually the trigger button) activates whatever
  the laser is pointing to, if it is interactive. The pinch action is used for
  the controller equivalent of clicking and dragging with the mouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some <a href="#tools">tools</a> allow you to use a controller's <span class="term">grip button</span>
  to interact. In this case, a tool will attach a <span class="term">hover guide</span> to
  the hands to help indicate what the grip action will affect. When active, the
  hover guide will show a connection to the interactive element that will be
  activated when the grip button is pressed. There are different types of hover
  guides; see the descriptions of the individual tools for details on grip
  dragging. The connection and guide are usually <a href="#colors">color-coded</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">hybrid mode</a>, some behind-the-scenes nonsense takes
place so that you can see the hands, guides, and pointers in the (non-VR)
window.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="radial-menus">Radial Menus</h2>
<p><img alt="Radial menu in VR" src="img/RadialMenuVR.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>In <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR or hybrid mode</a>, pressing the <span class="term">menu</span> button on a
controller activates a <span class="term">radial menu</span> attached to the corresponding
hand in the scene. Each button in a radial menu is a shortcut to some
action. Slide your thumb around the trackpad or move the joystick (depending on
the controller) to highlight the desired item and press the trackpad or
joystick button to activate it. The menu is dismissed when you activate any
radial menu button, if you press the <em>menu</em> button again, or if you press any
keyboard key.</p>
<p>Note that radial menus are also available for use with the mouse in
conventional mode via <a href="../CheatSheet">keyboard shortcuts</a>. In this mode, the menu
appears in a fixed position on the appropriate side of the window for
interaction with the mouse. You can configure the radial menu for each hand in
the <a href="#radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor Panel</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="alternate-interaction-mode">Alternate Interaction Mode</h2>
<p>Some interactive objects have two different modes of operation, regular and
what is referred to as <span class="term">Alternate Mode</span>. The term <span class="term">"Alt"</span>
is also used to refer to this mode within this guide, such as in "Alt-click",
"Alt-drag", or "Alt-select". <span class="tiny">Please do not confuse this with the "Alt"
key.</span></p>
<p>Alternate mode is activated by any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding down the shift key on the keyboard</li>
<li>Holding down the center button of either controller's trackpad/joystick.</li>
<li>Double-clicking with the mouse or pinch action. Note that this currently
  works only for Alt-clicking and not (yet) for Alt-dragging.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when clicking on a model to select it, the Alt version is to
multi-select the model or deselect it if it is already selected. When dragging
a handle in the <a href="#scale-tool">Scale Tool</a>, the Alt version performs a symmetric
scale about the model's center point instead of a asymmetric scale. Other uses
are described elsewhere in this guide.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="the-stage">The Stage</h2>
<p>The <span class="term">stage</span> is the large disc on the floor of the work area. Models
are placed on the stage by default when they are created.</p>
<p>The stage can be manipulated to change your view of the models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag it in a circular arc to rotate it along with the models on it.</li>
<li>Drag toward or away from the stage center to scale the stage and models on it
  up or down.</li>
<li>In conventional mode, the mouse wheel also scales the stage.</li>
<li><a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-clicking</a> anywhere on the stage resets it to its default size
  and rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rotating and scaling the stage is a fairly easy way to get a different
perspective on your models without modifying the models themselves. Another
option is to use <a href="#inspector-mode">inspector mode</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="viewing">Viewing</h2>
<p>MakerVR is designed to be maintain a relatively stable viewpoint. However,
there may be times when you want to change the view of your scene (in addition
to manipulating the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a> or using <a href="#inspector-mode">inspector mode</a>.</p>
<p>In VR mode, you can turn your head to see the room from different angles, if
you wish. In <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">conventional or hybrid mode</a>, you can use the right
mouse button to rotate the view. Additionally, the height slider on the pole on
the right side of <a href="#the-work-area">the work area</a> can be dragged up and down to raise
and lower your view of the room. Clicking on the ring brings you back to the
default height.  <a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-clicking</a> on the ring also resets the view
direction to the default, unless you are in VR mode (where the view always
aligns with your head, of course).</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="inspector-mode">Inspector Mode</h2>
<p>MakerVR provides a special <span class="term">inspector mode</span> that lets you easily
examine a model from all directions. To inspect a model, <a href="#selection">select it as the
primary selection</a>, and click on the <a href="#inspector-action">Inspector
action</a> icon.  A shortcut to this mode is to long-press (more
than a half-second or so) either the mouse button or laser pointer/pinch action
on a model, whether selected or not. There is also a <a href="../CheatSheet">keyboard
shortcut</a>.</p>
<p>When in <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR mode</a> with the headset on, the model will be attached to
the controller in the hand that initiated  inspection. You can move and turn
your hand around to see the model from all angles.</p>
<p>When in <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">conventional mode or hybrid mode</a>, the model will be enlarged
and placed in the middle of the application window. In conventional mode,
moving the mouse (no need to click) rotates the model. In hybrid mode,
interaction depends on whether inspector mode was initiated with the mouse. If
so, it is the same as conventional mode. If inspector mode was initiated with a
controller, that controller rotates the model as in VR mode.</p>
<p>Any key press, mouse click, or controller button press exits inspector mode.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="tooltips">Tooltips</h2>
<p>Anything in the application that is interactive responds to hovering with the
mouse or laser pointer by highlighting in some way. For most items, if you
hover long enough, a tooltip will appear with information about the
interaction. For example, hovering over a tool icon gives information about
what the tool does, while hovering over any model in the scene shows the name
of the model.</p>
<p>The delay for showing tooltips is a setting that can be edited in the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
Panel</a>. Setting the delay to 0 turns off tooltips completely.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="text-input">Text Input</h2>
<p>Some parts of the application require text input, such as editing the name of a
model or entering the name of a new file. Using the keyboard is always an
option for text. If you have the headset on in VR mode, you might not want to
take it off or put the controllers down just to edit text. You're in luck; text
editing in VR mode is available using
<a href="https://github.com/campfireunion/VRKeys">VRKeys</a>.  It provides a virtual
keyboard with a xylophone-like interface for editing text. It's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Attached to the front of the virtual keyboard is a bar that can be used to
reposition the keyboard. Grip-dragging this bar with either controller allows
you to move the bar and keyboard in all three dimensions to make it easier to
access.</p>

</section><section class="section1"><h1 id="models">Models</h1>
<p>MakerVR supports a variety of different types of models. Many model types have
a <a href="#specialized-tools">specialized tool</a> designed specifically for editing
them. Some (such as Sphere and Box models) have no specialized tools because
there is nothing that cannot be modifed with a <a href="#general-tools">general tool</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="geometric-operations">Geometric Operations</h2>
<p>One of the main features of MakerVR is the ability to create new models by
applying certain geometric operations.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="constructive-solid-geometry-csg">Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)</h3>
<p>One of the most useful ways to create a new model is to apply any of the three
<span class="term">constructive solid geometry (CSG)</span> operations to two or more models:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Union</span> adds all of the models together.</li>
<li><span class="term">Intersection</span> uses the intersection of all selected models.</li>
<li><span class="term">Difference</span> subtracts all secondary selections from the primary
  selection. Unlike the other two operations, difference is asymmetric, so the
  selection order really matters.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="img/CSGDifference.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/CSGIntersection.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/CSGUnion.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/CSGOperands.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" /></p>
<p>These images show the original operand models, a box and a cylinder, and the
resulting CSG union, intersection, and difference (cylinder subtracted from the
box).</p>
<p>Note that in some cases converting a model to a <a href="#converted-models">Clipped
model</a> and applying the <a href="#clip-tool">Clip Tool</a> may turn out to
be a simpler method of geometric editing.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="convex-hull">Convex Hull</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/HullCapsule.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/HullSpheres.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" /></p>
<p>Another geometric operation is the <span class="term">convex hull</span> operation, which
creates a new model from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">3D convex
hull</a> of one or more selected
models. This can be used to easily create different shapes. For example, here
is an easy way to create a capsule by applying the convex hull operation to two
spheres.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/HullDisk.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/HullTorus.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:100px;" /></p>
<p>The hull operation can sometimes be useful to apply to a single model, if the
model is not already convex. Here's an example of creating a rounded disk as
the convex hull of a torus.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="some-patience-required">Some Patience Required</h3>
<p>MakerVR uses the <a href="https://www.cgal.org/">CGAL library</a> to compute the
combinations of objects. Even though this library is very powerful, robust, and
well-optimized, it can still take some time to compute the results in complex
cases. This work is performed in a separate thread so that the application is
not frozen while it happens. While the computation is active, the combined
model may be displayed as a 3D hourglass and the mouse cursor (visible when not
in VR mode) will also be an hourglass.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="model-types">Model Types</h2>
<p>Models can be divided into three basic categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Primitive models</span>, which are created from scratch or imported from
  STL files.</li>
<li><span class="term">Converted models</span>, which are created by converting other types of
  models in order to apply a specialized tool. For example, if you want to
  create beveled edges on a Box model, you first convert it to a Beveled model,
  then use the <a href="#bevel-tool">Bevel Tool</a> to change the bevel if necessary.</li>
<li><span class="term">Combined models</span>, which are created by combining other models in
  different ways. The result may or may not have a specialized tool associated
  with it.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="primitive-models">Primitive Models</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="term">Box model</span> represents a 3D box with the length of all sides
  equal to 8 units by default. There is no specialized tool for a Box.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">Cylinder model</span> represents a closed cylinder that by default has
  a diameter and height of 8 units. Its axis of symmetry is aligned with the +Z
  ("up") axis. The <a href="#cylinder-tool">Cylinder Tool</a> is the specialized tool for a
  Cylinder; it allows you to change the top and bottom diameters independently.</li>
<li>An <span class="term">Imported model</span>, as its name suggests, is imported from an STL
  file. The specialized <a href="#import-tool">Import Tool</a> is used to select the file to
  import from and also to reimport the model if any changes were made to the
  STL file.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">RevSurf model</span> represents a closed surface of revolution,
  created by rotating a 2D profile about the Z axis. The default profile
  consists of 3 points (the minimum allowed) that forms a surface with the widest
  diameter of 8 units and a height of 8 units. The specialized <a href="#rev-surf-tool">Surface of
  Revolution Tool</a> lets you edit the profile and also the sweep
  angle of the surface.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">Torus model</span> represents a torus that by default has an outer
  diameter of 8 units and an inner diameter of 1.6 units. Its axis of symmetry
  is aligned with the +Z ("up") axis. The <a href="#torus-tool">Torus Tool</a> is the
  specialized tool for a Torus; it allows you to change the outer and inner
  diameters independently.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">Sphere model</span> represents a sphere that has a diameter of 8 units
  by default. There is no specialized tool for a Sphere.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">Text model</span> represents extruded 3D text, which is laid out by
  default at the origin along the +X axis, extruded 2 units along the +Z (up)
  direction. It is sized by default so that the characters are approximately 4
  units in the Y dimension.  The specialized <a href="#text-tool">Text Tool</a> allows you
  to change the text string, font, and character spacing.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="converted-models">Converted Models</h3>
<p>Each of these model types is created by <a href="#selection">selecting</a> one or more
models and clicking on the appropriate 3D icon to apply the action to convert
them. Once they are converted, you can use the corresponding specialized tool
to edit them, as listed below.</p>
<p>Note that this two-step process (converting and editing) makes it clear that a
new type of model must be created in order to apply the editing operation. The
converted model becomes a parent of the original model in the hierarchy (as
shown in the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree Panel</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="term">Beveled model</span> applies a bevel or other profile to edges of a
  model. The <a href="#model-conversion-shelf">Convert-to-Bevel action</a> is used to convert the
  models and the <a href="#bevel-tool">Bevel Tool</a> is used to modify the bevel profile.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">Clipped model</span> clips a model with one or more clipping
  planes. The <a href="#model-conversion-shelf">Convert-to-Clipped action</a> is used to convert
  the models and the <a href="#clip-tool">Clip Tool</a> is used to specify the plane(s).</li>
<li>A <span class="term">Mirrored model</span> mirrors a model about one or more principal
  planes. The <a href="#model-conversion-shelf">Convert-to-Mirrored action</a> is used to convert
  the models and the <a href="#mirror-tool">Mirror Tool</a> is used to specify how to
  mirror.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="combined-models">Combined Models</h3>
<p>A combined model is created by <a href="#selection">selecting</a> the appropriate number of

<ul>
<li>A <span class="term">CSG model</span> is created as a <a href="#constructive-solid-geometry-csg">constructive solid geometry

</ul>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="model-names">Model Names</h2>
<p>When MakerVR creates a model of any type, a unique name is assigned to it
automatically by affixing an underscore and a number to its base model type,
such as <code>"Sphere_1"</code> or <code>"Imported_13"</code>. Names can be seen and changed in the
<a href="#tree-panel">Tree Panel</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="model-colors">Model Colors</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/SpecialMeshColors.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>Reasonable colors are chosen automatically for new models created in the
scene. The <a href="#color-tool">Color Tool</a> allows you to change them for aesthetic
reasons; the colors have no effect on the 3D-printed model.</p>
<p>Two special colors are used for models that have invalid meshes (bright red) or
that at least partly lie outside the current <a href="#the-build-volume">build volume</a>
(bright cyan) if the build volume is visible, as shown here.</p>
<p>When an invalid mesh is detected, it will retain the invalid mesh color until
the problem is fixed. Changes made to such a model with the Color Tool will
still take effect, but you will not be able to see them while the model is
invalid. Also, some tools will be disabled when an invalid model is selected to
avoid compounding the problem.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="model-edge-display">Model Edge Display</h2>

</section><section class="section1"><h1 id="precision">Precision</h1>
<p>MakerVR offers several features to help you create 3D models with precise
dimensions and placement.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="precision-level">Precision Level</h2>
<p><img alt="The precision control" src="img/PrecisionControl.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:80px;" /></p>
<p>MakerVR provides a <span class="term">variable precision level</span> to help you attain
exact values during drag operations. There are three levels, each affecting
both linear operations (such as scaling and translation) and angular operations
(such as rotation).</p>
<ul>
<li>1 unit / 15&deg;</li>
<li>.1 unit / 5&deg;</li>
<li>.01 unit / 1&deg;</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming <a href="#coordinate-system-and-units">centimeter units</a>, the linear precision levels are 1cm, 1mm,
and .1mm, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="tiny">If you need higher precision than the finest values here, you should
probably use a different application.</span></p>
<p>There are three ways to change the current precision level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on one of the the two buttons on the precision control. (Top button
  to increase to finer precision; bottom button to decrease to coarser
  precision.)</li>
<li>Using <code>X</code> and <code>Z</code> <a href="../CheatSheet">keyboard shortcuts</a> to increase and decrease
  levels, respectively.</li>
<li>Clicking the Up or Down buttons on the VR controller trackpad/joystick.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the keyboard and controller shortcuts work even during drag and grip
drag operations. Modifying the precision setting during a drag has the
following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates the precision control text.</li>
<li>Changes the precision of the result of the current operation (position, size,
  etc.).</li>
<li>Changes the precision of the <a href="#visual-feedback">visual feedback</a>.</li>
<li><em>Changes the relative amount of drag motion.</em> This may be startling at first,
  but makes sense when you try it out. For example, if you want to move an
  object exactly 5.45 units to the right, you start out with 1 unit precision
  and drag it 5 units. While still dragging, increase precision to .1 unit and
  drag it .4 units more. This uses the same amount of drag motion that 4 units
  would at 1 unit precision, so it's much easier. Finally, increase precision
  again to .01 unit and drag another .05 units to the right, again with the
  corresponding amount of drag motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you get used to this, it becomes relatively easy to achieve precise
dimensions and distances interactively.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="visual-feedback">Visual Feedback</h2>
<p><img alt="Angular feedback" src="img/AngularFeedback.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" />
<img alt="Linear feedback" src="img/LinearFeedback.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>Most interactive drag operations display some sort of visual feedback.
Operations that are essentially linear show the current dimension of that
change along a line, while rotations show the current angle. Multi-dimensional
changes such as uniform scaling and spherical rotation show feedback in all
affected dimensions. The precision of the feedback matches the current
<a href="#precision-level">precision level</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback is colored according to the <a href="#colors">coordinate system convention</a> for
the appropriate dimension(s). When a drag is snapped to a <a href="#targets">target</a>,
feedback is displayed in the active target color.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="targets">Targets</h2>
<p>Interactive placement can sometimes be tedious, so MakerVR offers extra help
for some operations using <span class="term">targets</span>. There are two targets available
in the application, the <span class="term">point target</span> and <span class="term">edge target</span>.</p>
<p>To activate or deactivate a target, click on the corresponding toggle icon, as
described below. When activated, a visual representation of the target appears,
initially in the center of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a>. If the target is obscured by
models, you can use the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree Panel</a> to hide those models
temporarily.</p>
<p>Targets can be <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">dragged</a> to other locations, as described
below. While a target is being dragged, its color changes from the standard
target color (cyan) to the active target color (orange).</p>
<p>When dragging a target on the stage, the target will snap to grid locations
based on the current <a href="#precision-level">precision level</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="point-target">Point Target</h3>
<p><img alt="The point target" src="img/PointTarget.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>The point target indicates a position (shown by the sphere at the base) and
orientation (shown by the arrow) in the scene. To activate or deactivate the
point target, click on the <a href="#point-target-toggle">Point Target Toggle</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="effects">Effects</h4>
<p>When the point target is active, most position-based drag operations (such as
translation) will snap to the target's position in all affected dimensions.
When snapping occurs during one of these operations, both the <a href="#visual-feedback">visual
feedback</a> and target change to the active target color.</p>
<p>The point target can also be used for instantly positioning a model, and it has
other features that let it be used be used for radial layout; see <a href="#radial-layout">Radial
Layout</a> below for details.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="positioning-on-models-or-the-stage">Positioning on Models or the Stage</h4>
<p>The point target can be dragged by any part (except the ring) to any point on a
model or on the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a>. When dragging over a model's surface, the
target location will snap to vertices of the model's triangular mesh when close
enough to them, based on the current <a href="#precision-level">precision level</a>. When
this occurs, a <span class="term">snap indicator</span> (sphere at the tip of the target's
arrow) will appear.</p>
<p><a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the point target on a model uses the rectangular bounds
of the model instead of its mesh. The target will snap to the minimum, maximum,
and center values of the bounds in each dimension. You can use this feature to
more easily attach the point target to important points on objects with
asymmetric meshes.</p>
<p>When alt-dragging the point target, the snap indicator sphere will appear when
any snapping occurs, and is <a href="#colors">color-coded by dimension</a>. If snapping
occurs in two dimensions, the color will be the sum of the two dimensions'
color. For example, if alt-dragging the point target on the front (-Y) face of
a model's bounds, the indicator will be red (X) when snapping to the left edge,
center, or right edge of the face. It will be blue (Z) when snapping to the
bottom edge, center, or top edge of the face. It will be magenta (red + blue)
when snapping to both at the same time.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="edge-target">Edge Target</h3>
<p><img alt="The edge target" src="img/EdgeTarget.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>The edge target indicates a length and orientation in the scene. To activate or
deactivate the edge target, click on the <a href="#edge-target-toggle">Edge Target
Toggle</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="effects_1">Effects</h4>
<p>When the edge target is active, dragging during a size-based operation (such as
scaling a model or changing a cylinder or torus diameter) snaps to the target
length. When snapping occurs during one of these operations, both the
<a href="#visual-feedback">feedback</a> and the target change to the active target color.</p>
<p>The edge target can also be used for immediate linear layout. See <a href="#linear-layout">Linear
Layout</a> below for details.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="positioning-on-models-or-the-stage_1">Positioning on Models or the Stage</h4>
<p>When dragged over the surface of a model, the edge target snaps to the closest
edge of the model's mesh. (To see model edges more clearly, you can <a href="#model-edge-display">show the
edges</a>.) If the edge target is dragged from a model to the
<a href="#the-stage">stage</a>, it retains the length of the last edge it snapped to.</p>
<p><a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the edge target on a model uses the rectangular bounds
of the model instead of its mesh; the target will snap to the nearest edge of
the bounds. You can use this feature to easily set the edge target length to
any dimension of a model's bounds.</p>
<p>Clicking on the edge target reverses its direction, which is useful when
performing <a href="#linear-layout">linear layout</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>The point and edge targets can also be used to perform radial and linear
layout, respectively.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="radial-layout">Radial Layout</h3>
<p>The point target can also be used to lay out <a href="#selection">selected models</a> along
a circle or circular arc. All of the parameters of the layout are specified
using the features of the target. When they are all set, click on the <a href="#radial-layout-action">Radial
Layout icon</a> to lay out the selected models.</p>
<p>If exactly one model is selected and the Radial Layout icon is clicked, the
bottom center of the model will be moved to the point target's location and the
model's "up" (+Z) direction will be aligned with the point target's direction.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/PointTargetRadius.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" /></p>
<p>If two or more models are selected, clicking on the Radial Layout icon will lay
them out along a circle or arc. To set this up, you can use some extra features
of the point target. To use them, drag the ring of the target to make it
larger. As you do this, you will see <a href="#visual-feedback">feedback</a> above the arrow
showing the diameter of the ring, which will be the diameter of the circle or
arc for your layout. The radius follows the current <a href="#precision-level">precision
level</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/PointTargetRadiusActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" /></p>
<p>Intersecting the ring are two spokes, one green and one red. These are used to
modify the starting and ending angles for layout, respectively. If you drag the
green (starting) spoke, both spokes rotate around the circle. If you drag the
red (ending) spoke, only the red spoke moves. The arc connecting the spokes
shows the direction of the layout (green to red). If you want to reverse the
direction, drag the red spoke past the green one in the desired direction. As
you drag either spoke, color-coded feedback shows the angle of each spoke and
the subtended layout angle.  Note that the spoke angles also follow the current
<a href="#precision-level">precision level</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have set up the point target with the correct position, orientation,
radius, and angles, clicking on the <a href="#radial-layout-action">Radial Layout icon</a>
will position all selected models with their bottom centers along the circle or
arc (without changing their orientations). The selection order determines the
order in which they are laid out: the <a href="#selection">primary selection</a> will be at
the start angle, and the last-selected model will be at the end angle.</p>
<p>The point target retains the radial settings (diameter and angles) until you
reset it by dragging the ring back to its tiny state.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="linear-layout">Linear Layout</h3>
<p>The edge target can be used to lay out two or more models along a line. The
direction and length of the target determine the offset between models. The
<a href="#selection">primary selection</a> will not move. The center of the first secondary
selection will be placed at the offset from the primary model's center, and so
on for subsequent selected models, in selection order.</p>
<p>It may be useful to create a temporary model with the correct size as a layout
aid. For example, suppose you want to lay out 3 models along the X direction
with 6 units between their centers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a box and scale it so that it is 6 units in size in X (using 1 unit
  <a href="#precision-level">precision</a>.</li>
<li>Activate the edge target and drag it onto one of the box edges in the X
  direction. The target will then be exactly 6 units in length and lie along
  the X axis. Click on the edge target to flip it if it is pointing in the
  wrong direction.</li>
<li><a href="#delete-action">Delete</a> the box if you no longer need it.</li>
<li>Select the primary selection - the one that will not move.</li>
<li><a href="#selection">Alt-select</a> the other models you want to lay out, in order.</li>
<li>Click on the <a href="#linear-layout-action">Linear Layout icon</a> to lay them out.</li>
</ul>

</section><section class="section1"><h1 id="shelves-and-actions">Shelves and Actions</h1>
<p>Each 3D icon on the shelves in <a href="#the-work-area">the work area</a> represents an
<span class="term">action</span> that makes some sort of change to the scene or program
state. These actions can be divided into these general types:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="term">toggle action</span> changes some program state that is either on or

<ul>
<li><a id="edit-name-action"></a>The <span class="term">Edit-Name</span> action is the same as

</section><section class="section1"><h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
<p>Tools are interactive objects that attach to models in the scene to perform a
specific type of editing.</p>
<p>Tools are divided into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="term">general tool</span> can be attached to any model, regardless of its
  type*. Every general tool is a <span class="term">3D tool</span> that appears around or
  above the model being edited.</li>
<li>A <span class="term">specialized tool</span> can be applied only to a model of a specific
  type. It is used to modify unique editable features of that type of model.
  Some specialized tools are 3D tools, and some are <span class="term">panel tools</span>,
  meaning that they use a special <a href="#gui-panels">2D GUI panel</a> for interactive
  editing.</li>
</ul>
<p>*There is actually one exception to the general tools rule. The <a href="#complexity-tool">Complexity
Tool</a> cannot be used for certain model types.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="tool-attaching-and-switching">Tool Attaching and Switching</h2>
<p>MakerVR maintains a <span class="term">current general tool</span>, which is generally the
last general tool that was used. It is initially the <a href="#translation-tool">Translation
Tool</a>. You can switch to any other enabled general tool by
using the mouse or laser/pinch to select its icon on the <a href="#general-tool-shelf">General Tool
Shelf</a>.</p>
<p>You can also switch general tools with the
<a href="#switch-to-previous-tool-action">Switch-to-Previous-Tool</a> or
<a href="#switch-to-next-tool-action">Switch-to-Next-Tool</a> actions. The
<a href="../CheatSheet">shortcuts</a> for these are the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> keys or the Left and Right
buttons on either controller's trackpad/joystick.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, some <a href="#model-types">types of models</a> have corresponding
specialized tools. When a model of one of these types is created, the
corresponding specialized tool is automatically attached to it so you can edit
it. If the new model has no specialized tool, the current general tool will be
attached.</p>
<p>Switching between the current general tool and the specialized tool for a model
(if it has one) is done with the <a href="#specialized-tool-shelf">Specialized-Tool toggle
action</a>. The <a href="../CheatSheet">shortcut</a> for this is the
spacebar on the keyboard or the Center buttons on either controller's
trackpad/joystick. When a specialized tool is available or active, the 3D icon
for the toggle changes to reflect the tool. The 3D icon will be the same as the
3D icon of the action used to create a specialized model of that type (whether
through creation or conversion) with a yellow edit pencil in front of it.</p>
<p>When changing the <a href="#selection">selection</a>, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the last attached tool was any specialized tool and all selected models
  support the same specialized tool (not necessarily the current one), that
  tool will be attached to the primary selection.</li>
<li>In all other cases, the current general tool will be attached to the primary
  selection.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="general-tools">General Tools</h2>
<p>Each of these general tools can be activated by clicking on the corresponding
icon on the <a href="#general-tool-shelf">general tool shelf</a> or by switching to it as
described above.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="color-tool">Color Tool</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ColorToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" /></p>
<p>The Color Tool edits the color of all selected models. It is placed above the
primary selection. The disc in the center of the tool shows the current color
of the primary selection, as does the small marker in the outer ring. Clicking
or dragging anywhere in the ring moves the marker and changes the color of all
selected models. Grip-dragging works as well; the relative position of the
controller is used to move the marker around the ring.</p>
<p>Colors have no real effect on the 3D-printed model, but they can be used to
distinguish different parts while editing. Or just to make things look nicer.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="complexity-tool">Complexity Tool</h3>
<p>The Complexity Tool appears above the primary selection and changes the number
of triangles used to represent all selected models.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/HighComplexity.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/LowComplexity.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" /></p>
<p>Dragging the slider handle on the Complexity Tool updates the number of
triangles used for all affected selected models. Grip-dragging also works; the
relative position of the controller moves the handle. These images show two
positions of the handle applied to a cylinder's complexity.</p>
<p>Some important notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Complexity Tool has no effect on certain models and its icon will be
  disabled for those: Box models, Imported models, Combined models, or any
  model converted from one of these.</li>
<li>If you create a <a href="#converted-models">Converted model</a> from a model that supports
  complexity changes, the Complexity Tool will actually be modifying the
  complexity of the child model.</li>
<li>If you want to change the complexity of parts of a <a href="#combined-models">Combined
  model</a>, you can <a href="#parent-and-child-selection">select its child models</a>
  to modify their complexity; the Combined model will update appropriately when
  its children are no longer selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can use complexity to create different primitive models. The
lowest complexity Cylinder model is a triangular prism, and the lowest
complexity Sphere model is an octohedron. You can <a href="#model-edge-display">show the polygonal
edges</a> to see the triangles more clearly as in the above images.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="rotation-tool">Rotation Tool</h3>
<p>The Rotation Tool lets you rotate selected models. It has 3 color-coded rings
for rotating about the principal axes and a central sphere for doing free
spherical rotation. The rotation angle follows the current <a href="#precision-level">precision
level</a> setting and snaps to the current <a href="#point-target">point target
direction</a> if the target is active.</p>
<p>Color-coded <a href="#visual-feedback">feedback</a> shows the current rotation angle or angles
during an interactive drag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/RotationToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:140px;" /></p>
<p>The <a href="#selection">primary selection</a> is always rotated about its center point.
If multiple models are selected, secondary selections are rotated around the
same point, meaning that they revolve around the primary selection. However,
<a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">alt-dragging</a> the Rotation Tool causes all models to be rotated in
place about their own centers.</p>
<p>The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle">Axis-Aligned toggle</a> affects how the Rotation Tool is
attached to the primary selection. If the toggle is active, then the rings will
always be aligned with the principal axes of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a>, rather than
with the principal axes of the primary selection's local coordinates.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/RotationToolActiveVR.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>Grip-dragging uses the orientation of the VR controller to define the
rotation. A <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guide</a> attached to each controller hand indicates
what action will be performed. Note that the hover guide for rotation points
forward from the hand, unlike most other hover guides.  When the ring on the
guide is close to aligning with any of the axis rings on the Rotation Tool, the
guide will show a <a href="#colors">color-coded connection</a> to that ring. (In the
picture here, the ring is close to aligning with the red X-axis rotation ring
of the Rotation Tool.) In any other orientation, the guide will show a
neutral-color connection to the center sphere. If a ring is hovered, pressing
the grip button and rotating the controller ring around the guide axis will
rotate the model(s) the same way. When no ring is selected, the model(s) will
be free rotated to match the controller orientation.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="scale-tool">Scale Tool</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ScaleToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:160px;" /></p>
<p>The Scale Tool lets you change the size of selected models. It has several
double-ended sliders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three sliders aligned with the coordinate axes of the model. These scale
  nonuniformly in one dimension.</li>
<li>Eight sliders passing diagonally through edge centers. These scale
  nonuniformly in two dimensions.</li>
<li>Four sliders passing diagonally through the corners of the model's
  bounds. These scale uniformly in all three dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any dimension being scaled follows the current <a href="#precision-level">precision
level</a> and snaps to the current <a href="#edge-target">edge target
length</a> if the edge target is active. Color-coded
<a href="#visual-feedback">feedback</a> shows the current relevant dimension(s) of the primary
selection during a drag.</p>
<p>There are two scaling modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Asymmetric scaling</span> resizes the model about the opposite
  point. That is, when you drag a slider handle, the handle on the other end
  stays fixed. This is the default scaling mode when dragging a handle.</li>
<li><span class="term">Symmetric scaling</span> resizes the model about its center. When
  dragging a slider handle in this mode, the handle on the opposite side moves
  the same amount in the other direction. <a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-dragging</a> a slider
  handle performs symmetric scaling.</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiple models are selected, all secondary selections are scaled in place
in their local orientations by corresponding ratios. Note that the
<a href="#axis-aligned-toggle">Axis-Aligned toggle</a> has no effect on the Scale Tool, since
using different axes might cause confusing shearing to occur.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ScaleToolActiveVR.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>Grip-dragging uses the orientation of a VR controller to select a slider handle
to activate. A <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guide</a> attached to each controller hand shows
the direction that needs to align with the slider to activate its handle. When
the guide is close enough to being aligned with a slider, the guide will show a
<a href="#colors">color-coded connection</a> (neutral if not a 1-dimensional slider) to the
closest handle of that slider. When a handle is highlighted in this manner,
pressing the grip button and moving the controller along the slider direction
scales the model(s).</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="translation-tool">Translation Tool</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/TranslationToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:160px;" /></p>
<p>The Translation Tool lets you change the position of selected models. It adds a
double-ended slider along each of the principal axes. Dragging the handle at
either end translates all selected models along the corresponding axis.
Translation offsets follow the current <a href="#precision-level">precision level</a>
setting. It also snaps to the current <a href="#point-target">point target location</a> if
the target is active; snapping is done when the minimum, center, or maximum
value of the primary model's bounds in the translated dimension is aligned with
the target's position. Color-coded <a href="#visual-feedback">feedback</a> shows the current
translation amount during a drag.</p>
<p>The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle">Axis-Aligned toggle</a> affects how the Translation Tool
is attached to the primary selection. If the toggle is active, then the sliders
will always be aligned with the principal axes of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a>, rather
than with the local coordinates of the primary selection.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/TranslationToolActiveVR.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>Grip-dragging uses the orientation of the VR controller to select a slider
handle to activate. A <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guide</a> attached to each controller hand
shows the direction that needs to align with the slider to activate its
handle. When the guide is close enough to being aligned with a slider, the
guide will show a <a href="#colors">color-coded</a> connection to the closest handle of
that slider. When a handle is highlighted in this manner, pressing the grip
button and moving the controller along the slider direction translates the
model(s) along the axis in either direction (pull or push).</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="specialized-tools">Specialized Tools</h2>
<p>The following sections describe the various specialized tools. The 3D
specialized tools are listed first; the tools that use <a href="#gui-panels">2D GUI
panels</a> for interaction are grouped together at the end of this
section.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="clip-tool">Clip Tool</h3>
<p>The Clip Tool that allows you to remove parts of models with one or more
clipping planes. It is enabled when all of the selected models are Clipped
models. You can convert any model to a Clipped model with the
<a href="#convert-to-clipped-action">Convert-to-Clipped action</a>.</p>
<p>This tool has three interactive parts:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ClipToolInactive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>An arrow indicating the normal to the clipping plane. The part of the
  selected model(s) on the side of the plane with the normal is what will be
  clipped away when the plane is clicked. Dragging the arrow lets you
  reposition the plane along the normal.</li>
<li>A translucent sphere that can be rotated to change the orientation of the
  clipping plane.</li>
<li>A translucent quadrilateral representing the clipping plane. Clicking this
  quadrilateral adds a clipping plane to all selected Clipped models.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ClipToolClipped.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>Translating the plane by dragging the arrow is limited by the extents of the
primary model; it will not let you move the plane completely off this model.
The plane will snap to the <a href="#point-target">point target location</a> if the target
is active or to the center of the primary selection. The plane will change
color to the target color when it is snapped to either point.
<a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the arrow deactivates any snapping.</p>
<p>When rotating the plane by dragging the sphere, the plane normal will snap to
the <a href="#point-target">point target direction</a> if the target is active or to any of
the principal axes. If the <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle">Axis-Aligned toggle</a> is active,
the principal axes of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a> are used; otherwise, the local axes of
the primary model are used. The plane will change color when snapped to either
the target color or the <a href="#colors">color corresponding to a principal axis</a>.
<a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the sphere deactivates any snapping.</p>
<p>During interaction (translating or rotating), all selected objects will be
clipped in real time to show what will happen if the plane is clicked. The
real-time clipping stops when interaction ends.</p>
<p>Grip-dragging works for both translation and rotation. If the controller is
oriented so that the <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guide</a> attached to the controller is
nearly parallel to the plane normal arrow, grip-dragging will translate the
plane along the normal based on the controller position. Otherwise,
grip-dragging will rotate the sphere and plane based on the controller
orientation.  Snapping occurs as above unless <a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">alt-dragging</a>.</p>
<p>Any number of clipping planes can be applied to the same clipped model. When
the Clip Tool is attached to a clipped model, it aligns itself with the most
recent clipping plane applied to that model, if any.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="cylinder-tool">Cylinder Tool</h3>
<p>The Cylinder Tool is enabled when all selected models are Cylinder models. It
allows the top and bottom radii of all selected Cylinder models to be changed
to create cones or truncated cones.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/CylinderToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>The tool consists of two double-ended sliders, one at the top and one at the
bottom. The pair of handles on each slider always work symmetrically. The
radius being modified follows the current <a href="#precision-level">precision level</a>
setting and also snaps to the current <a href="#edge-target">edge target length</a> if the
target is active.  <a href="#visual-feedback">Feedback</a> shows the length of the current radius
during a drag.</p>
<p>Grip-dragging also works with the radius sliders. A <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guide</a>
attached to each controller shows which slider handle will be activated when
the grip button is pressed. The relative vertical position of the controller
chooses the top or bottom radius.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="mirror-tool">Mirror Tool</h3>
<p>The Mirror Tool is enabled when all selected models are <a href="#converted-models">Mirrored
models</a>. It mirrors the models across one or more principal
planes. When the tool is active, it adds 3 color-coded orthogonal planes to the
primary selection.  Clicking on any of the planes mirrors the model across it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/MirrorToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>The mirroring planes always pass through the center of the primary selection.
If multiple Mirrored models are selected, all secondary selections are mirrored
across the same planes, meaning that they will move to the opposite side of the
plane if they are not also bisected by the plane, in addition to being
mirrored. However, <a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">alt-clicking</a> on a mirroring plane causes each
Mirrored model to be mirrored in place as if the plane passed through its local
center.</p>
<p>The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle">Axis-Aligned toggle</a> affects how the Mirror Tool is
attached to the primary selection when the primary selection has been
rotated. If the toggle is active, then the mirroring planes will always be
aligned with the principal planes of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a> rather than with the
local coordinates of the primary selection.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="torus-tool">Torus Tool</h3>
<p>The Torus Tool is enabled when all selected models are Torus models. It allows
the inner and outer diameters of the selected Torus models to be changed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/TorusToolActive.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>The tool consists of two double-ended sliders, one horizontal and one
vertical. The horizontal slider changes the outer diameter, and the vertical
slider changes the inner diameter. The handles always operate symmetrically.
The diameter being modified follows the current <a href="#precision-level">precision
level</a> setting and also snaps to the current <a href="#edge-target">edge target
length</a> if the target is active. <a href="#visual-feedback">Feedback</a> shows the
length of both diameters during a drag of either slider.</p>
<p>Note that if the inner diameter is increased too much, the outer diameter will
be increased as well to keep the torus from intersecting itself. Reducing the
inner diameter during the same drag operation will reduce the outer diameter as
well up to its previous size.</p>
<p>Grip-dragging also may be used to modify either diameter. A <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover
guide</a> attached to each controller shows which slider handle will be
activated when the grip button is pressed. The relative orientation (closer to
horizontal or vertical) of the controller and guide chooses the outer or inner
diameter slider.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="gui-panel-tools">GUI Panel Tools</h3>
<p>Each of these specialized tools is a <a href="#gui-panels">2D GUI Panel</a> that appears in
the scene above the primary selection (although it may be moved). The details
of all panel interactions are described in the GUI Panel section.</p>
<p>The following table shows the model type each of these specialized tools is
associated with; the tool is enabled only when all selected models are of that
type. The third column names the 2D GUI Panel used to implement its
interaction. Sharp readers will notice a pattern in the table.</p>

<p>MakerVR uses a few conventional user interface panels. Although they appear in
the 3D work space, they are essentially 2D and are always aligned with the
XZ-plane.</p>
<p>Panels are divided into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Application panels</span> implement various application functions, such
  as loading sessions or modifying program settings. Application panels appear
  initially over the center of the <a href="#the-stage">stage</a>.</li>
<li><span class="term">Tool panels</span> are <a href="#gui-panel-tools">used for certain specialized
  tools</a>. A tool panel appears initially above the <a href="#primary-and-secondary-selections">primary
  selection</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree Panel</a> is a special beast and is described
elsewhere.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="moving-and-resizing-panels">Moving and Resizing Panels</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/PanelHandles.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>Panels are placed initially to be reasonably visible. Additionally, when
application panels are visible, they temporarily hide the scene contents so
there is no interference. Tool panels do not do this so you can see the results
of editing models with them.</p>
<p>You can move any application or tool panel if it is in an inconvenient place.
All panels have an interactive handle on the center of each edge that allows
you to move the panel. The left and right edge handles move the panel to the
left and right, and the top and bottom edge handles move it up and down. Once
an application or tool panel has been moved, it remembers its position.</p>
<p>Some panels (such as the <a href="#info-panel">Info Panel</a> shown here) also have
interactive sphere handles in the four corners that allow you to resize
them. Most panels have a minimum size and will not let you resize them smaller
than that.</p>
<p>All of these panel handles respond to grip-dragging; the orientation of a
controller determines which handle will be used. For example, if the <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover
guide</a> for the right controller is close to parallel to the X axis,
it will highlight the move handle on the right side, so you can grip-drag it.
If the panel has scale handles and the guide is close to the diagonal
direction, it will highlight the corrresponding scale handle.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="img/PanelColors.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>All panel buttons highlight when hovered with the mouse or laser pointer. A
  highlighted button will be shown with a blue background.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation between buttons is possible with arrow keys and also
  <code>tab</code>/<code>shift-tab</code>. The current keyboard-focused button is shown with a green
  background. If nothing is shown with focus, hitting the tab key should focus
  on the first button.</li>
<li>Disabled buttons are dark gray.</li>
<li>Clicking on a button with the mouse or pinch action activates it.</li>
<li>Pressing enter on the keyboard with a button focused activates it.</li>
<li>Pressing the <code>escape</code> key always cancels whatever the panel is doing and
  dismisses it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some panels contain scrolling areas when their contents are too large to
fit. You can scroll a panel using the scrollbar on the right (mouse only),
dragging the contents up or down (mouse only), or by pressing the Up or Down
trackpad/joystick buttons on a VR controller. The same is true for long
dropdown lists.</p>
<p>Note that most interactive elements also support clicking with the grip
button. When the <a href="#clicking-and-dragging">hover guide</a> is close enough to perpendicular to
the panel, it will highlight the GUI element that it will interact with.</p>

</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="session-panel">Session Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/SessionPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>The Session Panel is shown when the application starts and can also be brought
up at any time by clicking on the <a href="#session-panel-action">Session Panel action</a>
icon.  This panel is used to start, save, and load <a href="#sessions">sessions</a>.
Sessions are saved as text files with an <code>".mvr"</code> (MakerVR) extension. Feel
free to look at and edit the session files if that's your thing.</p>
<p>The Session Panel has the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Continue previous/current session</code>. When the application starts, this choice
  will be enabled if your previous session was saved with a name (which will
  appear here in parentheses). Click this to resume working in that session. If
  the panel is invoked during a session, clicking this button will act as if
  nothing happened.</li>
<li><code>Load session file</code>. This can be used to load a different session file with
  the <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a>; you will be informed if you made any changes to
  the current session (if any) that you might want to save.</li>
<li><code>Start new session</code>. This resets everything to empty and starts a new,
  unnamed session. If you do this during a session, you will be informed if you
  made any changes that you might want to save.</li>
<li><code>Save session</code>. If your session is already named, this will be enabled to
  save it again if you made any changes.</li>
<li><code>Save session as</code>. This lets you save your session with a different name
  using the <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a>.</li>
<li><code>Export Selection</code>. This lets you export the selected model(s) to a file,
  using a <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a> that also contains a dropdown that allows you
  to select the desired format (text or binary STL).</li>
<li><code>Help</code> (question mark icon at top left). Brings up the <a href="#help-panel">Help
  Panel</a>. Dismissing the Help Panel returns to the Session Panel.</li>
<li><code>Settings</code> (gear icon at top right). Brings up the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
  Panel</a>. Dismissing the Settings Panel returns to the Session
  Panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default directories for session files and STL files are both stored as user
settings and can be modified with the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="settings-panel">Settings Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/SettingsPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:240px;" /></p>
<p>The Settings Panel lets you modify application settings that are saved between
sessions. The location of the saved settings is defined by <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html">Unity
PlayerPrefs</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="default-directories">Default Directories</h4>
<p>The first three settings are the default directories for saving and loading
sessions, STL model import, and STL model export. Each of these lets you <a href="#text-input">enter
text</a> for the directory name or click on the <code>Browse</code> button to open
a <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a> for that item.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="tooltip-delay">Tooltip Delay</h4>
<p>Next is a slider to adjust the time it takes for <a href="#tooltips">tooltips</a> to appear
when hovering the mouse or laser pointer over an interactive object.  Values
are in seconds, from 0 at the left to 5 at the right. Setting this to 0
disables tooltips completely.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="build-volume-size">Build Volume Size</h4>
<p>Next are three text input fields that allow you to specify the size of the
<a href="#the-build-volume">build volume</a> in all three dimensions, using the current
<a href="#coordinate-system-and-units">units</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="unit-conversion">Unit Conversion</h4>
<p>Next are two pairs of dropdowns allowing conversion of units on model import

</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="radial-menus_1">Radial Menus</h4>
<p>The last button brings up the <a href="#radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor

</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="info-panel">Info Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/InfoPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>The Info Panel shows information about all selected models, including the
number of vertices, number of triangles, and size in all three dimensions. If
any model has an invalid mesh, this is noted, along with the reason it is
considered invalid.</p>
<p>The info area in the panel will contain scroll bars if there is more text than
will fit. Also note that the Info Panel has resize handles (spheres) in the
corners to change its size.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="help-panel">Help Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/HelpPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>The Help Panel shows text with the current application version. There are two
buttons below the text. The first one brings up this user guide in your default
browser. The second one shows the <a href="../CheatSheet">Cheat Sheet</a> in the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/RadialMenuEditorPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:256px;" /></p>
<p>This panel can be opened from the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a> to edit the
<a href="#radial-menus">radial menus</a>. The radio buttons in the box at the top let you
choose one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Use Independent Settings</code>: The buttons defined for each controller are used
  for that controller.</li>
<li><code>Use Left Settings for Both</code>: The buttons defined for the left controller are
  used for both controllers.</li>
<li><code>Use Right Settings for Both</code>: The buttons defined for the right controller
  are used for both controllers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set the number of buttons to use on a controller to 1, 2, 4, or 8. The
menu diagram updates to reflect the current number. Clicking on any button in
the diagram brings up the <a href="#action-panel">Action Panel</a> to let you choose the
<a href="#shelves-and-actions">action</a> attached to that button. Each action is indicated by a
horribly-designed 2D icon that will show up in the radial menu diagram and in
the actual radial menu as well. The null icon
(<img alt="" src="img/MINone.png" style="height:32px;" />) is shown when no real action is bound to a
button.</p>
<p>In <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR and hybrid modes</a> you can activate a radial menu by pressing
the menu button on a controller.  Radial menus are also available in
conventional mode via <a href="../CheatSheet">keyboard shortcuts</a> for use with the mouse.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="action-panel">Action Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ActionPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:256px;" /></p>
<p>The Action Panel is used by the <a href="#radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor
Panel</a> to select the <a href="#shelves-and-actions">action</a> associated with a
radial menu button. It presents a scrolling list of actions to choose from,
organized by category. The action that is currently bound to the button being
modified is marked as <code>[CURRENT]</code>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../CheatSheet">Cheat Sheet</a> for a list of all actions and their
associated icons.</p>

</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="file-panel">File Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/FilePanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:256px;" /></p>
<p>The File Panel is used by the <a href="#session-panel">Session Panel</a> and the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
Panel</a> when a directory or file needs to be chosen. In addition,
the <a href="#import-tool-panel">Import Tool Panel</a> is essentially a File Panel.</p>
<p>This panel works pretty much like a standard file browser. The four buttons at
the top go to the previous directory (if any), the next directory (if you went
to the previous one), one directory up, or your home directory. A button at the
bottom lets you see hidden files and directories (operating-system-specific).</p>
<p>The scrolling list is color coded for directories and files, with directories
listed first.</p>
<p>The File Format dropdown at the top right is used for selecting a format when
<a href="#session-panel">exporting models</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="tool-panels">Tool Panels</h2>
<p>Each of these tool panels is a specialized tool for the corresponding type of
model. See <a href="#gui-panel-tools">this table</a> for the (obvious) connections.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="bevel-tool-panel">Bevel Tool Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/BevelToolPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:256px;" /></p>
<p>The Bevel Tool Panel lets you edit the bevel created for all Beveled models
once they have been <a href="#convert-to-beveled-action">created from other models</a>. The
bevel can actually be any sort of <span class="term">profile</span> applied to edges to
create various effects such as chamfering or rounding.</p>
<p>The panel initially shows the current profile of the <a href="#primary-and-secondary-selections">primary
selection</a>. The edited profile is applied to edges of all
selected Beveled models; the models update in real time as the profile is
edited.</p>
<p>The profile is drawn in the profile editing area and interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The upper-right corner is where the edge is located, looking along its
  length.</li>
<li>The upper-left and lower-right points of the profile are at fixed locations
  and are colored blue to indicate this. You can add new points between them,
  move those points around, and delete points.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default profile is just a line connecting the two fixed points, which
creates a bevel for all edges.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="editing-the-profile-with-mouse-or-pinch">Editing the Profile with Mouse or Pinch</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="img/BevelDeleteBox.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:160px;" /></p>
<p>Clicking anywhere on or near the profile line (except very close to an existing
point) creates a new interior point at that spot. New points are rendered the
same way as other interactive objects to indicate that they are movable.
Dragging on or near the line (instead of clicking) creates a new point and
immediately starts dragging it. Dragging an existing interior point moves it;
when you do this, a box with an "X" in it appears to allow you to delete the
point by dragging it over that box, as illustrated here.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="editing-the-profile-with-grip-drag">Editing the Profile with Grip Drag</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="UserGuide/img/BevelGripMidpoint.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:160px;" />
<img alt="" src="UserGuide/img/BevelGripPoint.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:160px;" /></p>
<p>When <a href="#interacting-with-panel-elements">grip hovering selects the profile editing area</a>, it
will highlight each movable point and also the midpoint of each profile line
segment, whichever is closest to the current relative controller position. The
midpoint is rendered as a blue square, as shown here. When a point is
highlighted, grip dragging moves that point. When a midpoint square is
highlighted, grip dragging creates a new point along that segment and starts
dragging it. As in the mouse/pinch case, a delete box with an "X" appears to
allow points to be removed.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="profile-scaling">Profile Scaling</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="img/BevelScaleLarge.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" />
<img alt="" src="img/BevelScaleSmall.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>The slider at the bottom of the panel allows you to scale the size of the
profile as it is applied to edges without having to readjust any points. For
example, you can create a rounding profile and change the radius by adjusting
the slider as shown here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="maximum-angle">Maximum Angle</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="img/BevelMaxAngle.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:220px;" /></p>
<p>The slider on the right side of the panel allows you to change the maximum edge
angle, from 0 to 180 degrees. This determines which model edges are beveled.
For example, suppose you have a cylinder and want to bevel just the edges
forming the top and bottom faces, as shown here. These edges form 90 degree
angles, so as long as the maximum angle is at least 90, they will have the
bevel profile applied. The edges between faces forming the sides are typically
greater than 90 degrees (unless the cylinder has very low
<a href="#complexity-tool">complexity</a>; as long as the maximum angle is smaller than that
those edges will be left alone.  The default is 120 degrees.</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="csg-tool-panel">CSG Tool Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/CSGToolPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:180px;" /></p>
<p>The CSG Tool Panel is a very simple panel that lets you change the <a href="#constructive-solid-geometry-csg">CSG
operation</a> applied to all selected CSG models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="import-tool-panel">Import Tool Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/ImportToolPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:220px;" /></p>
<p>The Import Tool Panel is essentially a <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a> that lets you
reimport the mesh used for an <a href="#primitive-models">Imported model</a> or to change
which file to import it from. If multiple Imported models are selected, all of
them will be changed to use the new file if one is selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="revsurf-tool-panel">RevSurf Tool Panel</h3>
<p>The RevSurf Tool Panel lets you edit the profile that is revolved around the +Z
axis for all selected <a href="#primitive-models">RevSurf (surface of revolution)
models</a>. The panel initially shows the current profile of the
<a href="#primary-and-secondary-selections">primary selection</a>. The edited profile is applied to all
selected RevSurf models; the models update in real time as the profile is
edited.</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="profile-editing">Profile Editing</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="img/RevSurfToolPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>Profile editing is essentially the same as in the <a href="#bevel-tool-panel">Bevel Tool
Panel</a>, with two (related) exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default profile has 3 points as shown here.</li>
<li>There must be at least 3 points in the revolved profile, so the panel will
  not let you delete a movable point if it is the only one left.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
</section><section class="section4"><h4 id="sweep-angle">Sweep Angle</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="img/RevSurfSweep.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:256px;" /></p>
<p>Below the profile editing area is a slider that lets you set the sweep angle in
degrees for the surface. The default is 360, meaning that the profile makes a
complete revolution. Values less than 360 result in a partial sweep with end
cap polygons, as shown here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
</section><section class="section3"><h3 id="text-tool-panel">Text Tool Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/TextToolPanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:200px;" /></p>
<p>The Text Tool Panel lets you edit the text string and font characteristics used
to create 3D text for all selected <a href="#primitive-models">Text models</a>. The panel
initially shows the values for the <a href="#primary-and-secondary-selections">primary selection</a>. All
changes made with the panel affect all selected Text models.</p>
<p>The panel lets you specify the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text string.</li>
<li>Font family. You can select from the dropdown list containing all available
  font families.</li>
<li>Font style. This dropdown lets you select from the styles available for the
  currently-selected family.</li>
<li>Character spacing (slider). This factor multiplies the spacing between
  individual characters to move them closer together or further apart. The
  default is 1, which is the spacing defined by the font.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the text shown in this image has been rotated to face the camera for
demonstration purposes, since it is extruded in the +Z direction for 3D
printing.</p>

</section><section class="section1"><h1 id="tree-panel">Tree Panel</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="img/TreePanel.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:160px;" /></p>
<p>The Tree Panel is the framed board on the back wall. It has multiple uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying a list of all models in the scene, including their tree structure
  and current status.</li>
<li>Selecting models.</li>
<li>Toggling model visibility.</li>
<li>Editing model names.</li>
<li>Changing order of models.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="session-name-and-status">Session Name and Status</h2>
<p>The current name of the session being edited is shown at the top of the panel.
If the session has not yet been saved with a name, it will show as
<code>&lt;Untitled&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If the session has been modified since it was loaded, there will be a
modification string within square brackets after the session name.  This string
may contain the following characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>An asterisk (<code>'*'</code>) indicates that one or more models has been created or
  modified and not undone.</li>
<li>An exclamation point (<code>'!'</code>) indicates that the session state (such as edge
  visibility or bound volume visibility) has changed.</li>
<li>A plus sign (<code>'+'</code>) indicates that the set of commands in the session file
  has changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a session can be saved if any of these symbols appears. For example,
if you make changes to models and then undo back to their original state, there
will be no asterisk, but the plus sign lets you know that the session can still
be saved (because the sequence of commands has changed). The session state is
also saved, so changing it allows you to save as well.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="model-names_1">Model Names</h2>
<p>Each row under the top row of the panel represents a model in the scene. Any
model that has children will show those children as indented names under its
name. There will also be a triangle that you can click or pinch to collapse or
expand the children. Clicking on a model name <a href="#selecting-models">selects that
model</a>.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="text-colors">Text Colors</h2>
<p>Each model displayed in the Tree Panel is shown with its name in color-coded
text to indicate its status:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="color:rgb(212,20,20)">primary selection is red</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(0,0,254)">secondary selections are blue</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(128,10,117)">models with visibility off are
  purple</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(102,102,102)">children hidden because their

<li>All <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">other models are black</span>.</li>
</ul>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="font-size">Font Size</h2>
<p>The slider on the right of the Tree Panel changes the font size of the text and
the sizes of all of the buttons.  This can be useful if you have a lot of
models and want to see more of them or to use <a href="#selecting-models">rectangle
selection</a> on more names.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="changing-visibility">Changing Visibility</h2>
<p>Each model name in the Tree Panel has a little eye icon to its left. Clicking
this icon toggles the visibility of the corresponding model in the scene.</p>
<p>There is also an eye icon next to the session name at the top. If any model is
currently hidden, clicking this will show all models (the <a href="#show-all-action">Show All
action</a>. Otherwise, it will hide all models..</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="selecting-models">Selecting Models</h2>
<p>Clicking with the mouse or pinch on a model name selects it as the primary
selection. <a href="#alternate-interaction-mode">Alt-clicking</a> on a model name toggles its selection
status.</p>
<p>You can also use the mouse or pinch to drag out a selection rectangle in the
panel. All model names intersected by the rectangle will be selected. <a href="#reordering-models">Changing
the order of names</a> may help in some cases.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot have both a parent and child model selected at the same
time. Allowing this would be horrendous.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="changing-model-names">Changing Model Names</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/EditName.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:32px;" /></p>
<p>MakerVR creates names for new models using the type of model and a numerical
suffix to guarantee uniqueness. You can use the edit button on the top right of
the panel to bring up a text editing field that lets you <a href="#text-input">edit</a> the
current name of the model. It will not let you create a duplicate name.</p>
</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="reordering-models">Reordering Models</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/MoveUpDown.jpg" style="float:right; margin:2px; height:64px;" /></p>
<p>There are some cases where the order of models in the Tree Panel matters. One
is when you want to use <a href="#selecting-models">rectangle selection</a> to select
some set of models. Another is when the order of children within a parent
matters, such as within a <a href="#constructive-solid-geometry-csg">CSG difference</a>. In these cases the move-up
(<a href="#move-previous-action">Move Previous action</a>) and move-down (<a href="#move-next-action">Move Next
action</a>) buttons can be used to move the primary selection up
and down in the list. Note that if the primary selection is not a top-level
model, it can only be moved up and down within its parent model.</p>

</section><section class="section2"><h2 id="copy-paste-undo-redo">Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo</h2>
<p>The interactions between copy and paste operations, coupled with undo and redo,
are generally intuitive, but may require some explanation. Here are the basic
rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying a model to the clipboard creates a clone of the model, meaning that
  any changes to the original model will not affect the copy.</li>
<li>Pasting a model from the clipboard also creates a clone, so that changes to
  the pasted model will not affect the model in the clipboard or any other
  models created by pasting it at other times.</li>
<li>Pasted clones will have the same name as the original model in the clipboard,
  but with a letter appended to it after an underscore (such as <code>"Box_1_A"</code>).</li>
<li>Undoing and redoing a paste operation always pastes the exact models that
  were pasted the first time.</li>
<li>Undoing and redoing any commands have no effect on the contents of the
  clipboard. Note that you can use this feature to your advantage if you want
  to undo back to an earlier state but still have another model available to
  paste into the scene.</li>
