<h1 id="makervr-user-guide">MakerVR User Guide</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>MakerVR helps you create models that you can then send to a 3D printer.
It is designed to be relatively simple to use, even for someone with little to
no 3D modeling experience. If you are intimidated by 3D modelers like Blender,
you might find MakerVR useful.</p>
<p>MakerVR is inspired somewhat by <a href="http://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> (my favorite
program for creating 3D models). OpenSCAD is great if you don't mind typing in
numbers for everything and have a reasonable amount of 3D graphics
experience. MakerVR is designed to have a similar amount of power while still
being useful to beginners.</p>
<p>Because precision is extremely important when 3D printing, MakerVR has several
features that allow you to create models with exact dimensions, orientations,
and positions.</p>
<h3 id="vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR and Non-VR Modes</h3>
<p>MakerVR was originally designed to operate in a virtual environment because I
it seemed like it would be a fun experience. But, since most people do not have
a VR setup, I thought it might be useful if it also worked without VR, using
just a conventional mouse and keyboard setup. And, since putting on and taking
off a headset can be very inconvenient while developing an application
(especially if you happen to wear glasses), I thought it might be useful and
fun to allow using the VR controllers even without the headset. This turned out
to be possible!</p>
<p>Each of these modes is called out in this guide when interaction differs among
them. The modes are named as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>VR mode</em> is when you have a VR device hooked up, you are wearing the
  headset, and are holding the controllers.</li>
<li>In <em>conventional mode</em>, you either do not have a VR device hooked up or you
  do, but are just choosing to use the mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li><em>Hybrid mode</em> is halfway between the other two: you have a VR device hooked
  up, you do not have the headset on, and you have at least one VR controller
  in your hand(s). Some behind-the-scenes nonsense takes place so that you can
  see the hands in the (non-VR) window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some VR experiences allow you or force you to walk around while using them.
That wouldn't make sense for this application, so it is designed to make
everything useful from one spot. If you're planning to use the VR mode, set it
up for a comfortable, fixed standing or seated position. Note that the scene
view is set up for sitting, so you may need to adjust your VR positioning for a
different height if you prefer to stand.</p>
<h3 id="interaction">Interaction</h3>
<p>MakerVR responds to mouse and keyboard actions in any of the three modes. Let's
assume everyone knows how to use them, including <a href="../CheatSheet/">Keyboard
shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>The VR controllers may be used in VR or Hybrid mode. MakerVR was developed
using an HTC Vive (since that's what I have), but should (!) work with any
standard VR controllers supported by
<a href="https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/">SteamVR</a>.</p>
<p>Controller use is as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ControllerVR.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin:2px;" title="Controller feedback with laser pointer and hover guide" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The controllers appear in the VR scene as hands that react to interaction,
  courtesy of <a href="https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/">SteamVR</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cyan laser pointer emanates from the forward direction of each controller.
  the <em>pinch</em> action (usually some sort of trigger) activates whatever the
  laser is pointing to, if it is interactive. This action is equivalent to
  clicking the left mouse button on the same spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some tools attach a <em>hover guide</em> to the hands to help indicate what will
  happen if you activate the <em>grip</em> action. The guide will show a pointer to
  the interactive element in the scene that will be activated when the grip
  button is pressed. There are different types of hover guides; see the
  documentation for the individual tools for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/RadialMenuVR.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin:2px;" title="Radial menu in VR" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>menu</em> button activates a radial menu attached to the controller. Each
  item in the radial menu is a shortcut to some action. Slide your thumb around
  the trackpad to highlight the desired item and press anywhere on the trackpad
  to activate it. The menu is dismissed when you activate any radial menu
  button or if you press the <em>menu</em> button again or press any keyboard
  key. Note that radial menus are also available for use with the mouse in
  conventional mode via <a href="../CheatSheet/">keyboard shortcuts</a>. In this mode,
  the menu appears in a fixed position on the appropriate side of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure the radial menu for each hand in the <a href="#radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor
Panel</a>.</p>
<p>Any panel that uses a dropdown list of options (such as the [Text
Panel][#text-panel] for font family or style) allows scrolling of the list
using the trackpad up/down buttons on a controller.</p>
<p>Any use of the word <em>"drag"</em> in this document refers by default to using the
mouse or pinch action to grab some interactive widget and yank it around. A
drag activated with the grip button held down will be called out as a <em>"grip
drag"</em>.</p>
<h3 id="text-input">Text Input</h3>
<p>Some parts of the application require text input: editing the name of a model,
typing in a new file name, and maybe something else in the future. Who knows?</p>
<p>Using the keyboard is always an option for text. If you have the headset on in
VR mode, you might not want to take it off or put the controllers down just to
edit text. You're in luck; text editing in VR mode is available using
<a href="https://github.com/campfireunion/VRKeys">VRKeys</a>.  It provides a virtual
keyboard with a xylophone-like interface for editing text. It's pretty cool.</p>
<p>In front of the virtual keyboard is a bar that can be used to reposition the
keyboard. Holding down a grip button on either controller allows you to drag
the bar and keyboard in all three dimensions to make it easier to access.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-input-mode">Alternate Input Mode</h3>
<p>A few operations can be modified by either pressing the shift key on the
keyboard, pressing the center of either controller trackpad, or by
double-clicking. You will see this referred to as <em>"Alternate Mode"</em> or just
<em>"Alt"</em> in this documentation. For example, when clicking on a model to select
it, the Alt version is to multi-select the model or deselect it if it is
already selected. When dragging a handle in the <a href="#scale-tool">Scale Tool</a>, the
Alt version performs a symmetric scale about the model's center point.</p>
<h3 id="sessions">Sessions</h3>
<p>Unlike many applications that save your work as a data file, MakerVR stores
your <em>session</em> as a series of commands that you have executed. This means that
you can save your session, quit, restart your session, and be back pretty much
where you were. You can undo all of your work back to the beginning, if you
feel like it.</p>
<p>When you start the application, the first thing you see is the <a href="#session-panel">Session
Panel</a>. It offers you the chance to continue the current
session (if there is one), load a different session, or start a new session.
The location of saved sessions is customizable in the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The current state of various settings (such as whether <a href="#targets">targets</a> and
<a href="#show-edges-toggle-tool">edges</a> are visible) is saved along with the session
and is restored when the session is loaded.</p>
<p>The name of the current session file is displayed at the top of the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree
Panel</a>. The name is followed by a <a href="#session-name-and-status">string indicating whether the
scene or settings have been modified</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-work-area">The Work Area</h2>
<p><img alt="The MakerVR Work Area" src="../img/WorkArea.jpg" title="The (empty) MakerVR work area" /></p>
<p>The work area in MakerVR is based conceptually on a virtual workshop. You may
notice the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four walls, a floor, and a ceiling. They just provide scene context.</li>
<li>An exit sign. Clicking on this exits the application.</li>
<li>A large disc in the middle of the floor with a grid on it. This is the
  <em>stage</em>, where your models will appear. The stage can be manipulated to
  change your view of the models. Drag it in a circular arc to rotate it. Drag
  it toward or away from the center to scale it up or down. In conventional
  mode, the mouse wheel (if any) also scales the stage.
  <a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-clicking</a> on the stage resets it to its default
  size and orientation.</li>
<li>A pole on the right with a ring around it. That ring is a slider that can be
  dragged up and down to raise and lower your view of the room. Clicking on the
  ring brings you back to the default height.
  <a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-clicking</a> on the ring also resets to the default
  view direction, unless you are in VR mode (where the view always aligns with
  your head, of course).</li>
<li>Several shelves with 3D icons on them. These represent various
  <a href="#Tools">tools</a> that can interact with models or change session state.</li>
<li>A caliper to the right of the exit sign with text that shows the current
  precision, along with buttons to increase or decrease it. See
  <a href="#precision">Precision</a> for details.</li>
<li>A framed panel on the right of the back wall that has a bunch of stuff on
  it. This is the <em>tree panel</em> that shows your models in tree form and lets you
  interact with them there. It has enough features to warrant <a href="#tree-panel">its own
  section</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coordinate-system-and-units">Coordinate System and Units</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/CoordSys.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" title="The MakerVR coordinate system" /></p>
<p>MakerVR uses the same coordinate system that most 3D printing software uses:
right-handed, with +X to the right, +Y away from the viewer, and +Z up. The
stage surface is at Z=0.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:6pt;">Don't let the fact that this application is built
on Unity with its ridiculous left-handed coordinate system bother you.</span></p>
<p>MakerVR is essentially unit-independent. The only places where units are
considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>When models are imported or exported from or to STL files.</li>
<li>When the 3D printer <a href="#build-volume-toggle-tool">build volume</a> is shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a> allows you to specify <a href="#unit-conversion">how to convert
units</a> when importing and exporting, and also how large the
build volume is in whatever units you would like to work in.</p>
<p>For example, the application assumes everything is expressed in centimeter
units. If your 3D printing software expects STL files in millimeter units, you
can convert from centimeters to millimeters on export. If you are importing an
STL file that is in millimeters, you can convert from millimeters to
centimeters on import.</p>
<p>If you want for some reason to work in inches, you can just consider the
working units to be inches, and use the same conversion facilities to convert
to and from saner units.</p>
<p>Note that the grid on the stage has thin lines every 1 unit, with thicker lines
every 5 units. The grid grows or shrinks with the stage so that you can always
tell absolute sizes. The X and Y axes are colored red and green for reference.</p>
<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>
<p>Most everything in the application that aligns with the coordinate axes uses
the standard RGB color scheme: X is red, Y is green, Z is blue, as shown
above. This is true for noninteractive tool parts and <a href="#feedback">interactive visual
feedback</a>.</p>
<h4 id="model-colors">Model Colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/SpecialMeshColors.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Reasonable colors are chosen automatically for new models created in the
scene. The <a href="#color-tool">Color Tool</a> allows you to change them for aesthetic
reasons, since the colors have no effect on the 3D-printed model.</p>
<p>Two special colors are used for models that have invalid meshes (bright red) or
that at least partly lie outside the current <a href="#build-volume-toggle-tool">build
volume</a> (bright cyan) if the build volume is
visible, as shown here.</p>
<p>When an invalid mesh is created (usually by the <a href="#profile-tool">Profile Tool</a>),
it will retain the invalid mesh color until the problem is fixed. Changes made
with the Color Tool will still take effect, but you will not be able to see
them while the model is invalid. Also, some tools (such as <a href="#csg">CSG</a>,
<a href="#clip-tool">Clip</a>, and <a href="#convex-hull">Convex Hull</a> Tools) will be disabled
when an invalid model is selected.</p>
<h3 id="tooltips">Tooltips</h3>
<p>Anything in the application that is interactive responds to hovering with the
mouse or laser pointer by highlighting in some way. For many items, if you
hover long enough, a tooltip should appear with information about the
interaction. Hovering over a model shows the name of the model.</p>
<p>The delay for showing tooltips is a setting that can be edited in the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
Panel</a>. Setting the delay to 0 turns off tooltips completely.</p>
<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/PrecisionControl.jpg" style="height:80px;float:right;" title="The precision control" /></p>
<p>Manual interaction is usually imprecise, so MakerVR provides several features
to help with that. One is a <em>variable precision setting</em> for drag operations.
The change created by an interactive drag or grip drag is snapped to the
current precision setting.</p>
<p>The <em>precision control</em> (with the caliper to the right of the exit sign) shows
the current precision setting. There are three such settings that apply to both
linear and angular operations (shown here using centimeter
<a href="#coordinate-system-and-units">units</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>1cm / 15&deg;</li>
<li>.1cm (1mm) / 5&deg;</li>
<li>.01cm (.1mm) / 1&deg;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:6pt;">If you need higher precision than the finest
values here, you should probably use a different application.</span></p>
<p>The buttons to the left of the calipers increase or decrease the current
precision. There are also <a href="../CheatSheet/">shortcuts</a>: <code>X</code> and <code>Z</code> keys on
the keyboard and the Up and Down buttons on the VR controller trackpad.</p>
<p>Modifying the precision setting is most useful during a drag or grip drag
operation, when it has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates the precision control text.</li>
<li>Changes the precision of the current operation (position, size, etc.).</li>
<li>Changes the precision of the [visual feedback][#feedback].</li>
<li><em>Changes the relative amount of drag motion.</em> This may be startling at first,
  but makes sense when you try it out. For example, if you want to move an
  object exactly 5.45cm to the right, you start out with 1cm precision and drag
  it 5cm. While still in the drag operation, increase precision to .1cm and
  drag it .4cm more. This uses the same amount of drag motion that 4cm would at
  1cm precision, so it's much easier. Finally, increase precision again to
  .01cm and drag another .05cm to the right, again with the corresponding
  amount of drag motion. This behavior is applied to both drags and grip drags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you get used to this, it becomes relatively easy to apply precise changes
interactively. See the <a href="#targets">section on targets</a> for another aid.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/AngularFeedback.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin:2px;" title="Angular feedback" />
<img alt="" src="../img/LinearFeedback.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin:2px;" title="Linear feedback" /></p>
<p>Most interactive drag operations display some sort of visual feedback.
Operations that are essentially linear show the current dimension of that
change along a line, while rotations show the current angle. Multi-dimensional
changes such as uniform scaling and spherical rotation show feedback in all
affected dimensions. The precision of the feedback matches the current
<a href="#precision">precision</a> setting.</p>
<p>Feedback is colored according to the <a href="#colors">coordinate system convention</a>
for the appropriate dimension(s). When a drag is snapped to a
<a href="#targets">target</a>, feedback is displayed in the active target color.</p>
<h3 id="targets">Targets</h3>
<p>Interactive placement can often be tedious, so MakerVR offers some shortcuts
for some operations using <em>targets</em>. There are two such targets available in
the application, the <em>point target</em> and <em>edge target</em>.</p>
<p>To activate or deactivate a target, click on the corresponding toggle tool. A
target becomes visible when activated, appearing initially in the center of the
stage. If it is obscured by models, you can use the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree Panel</a>
to hide those models temporarily.</p>
<p>Targets can be dragged with the mouse or pinch action to other locations, as
described below. When dragging on the stage, the targets snap to grid locations
based on the current <a href="#precision">precision</a>. When a target is dragged, its
color changes from the standard target color (cyan) to the active target color
(orange).</p>
<h4 id="point-target">Point Target</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/PointTarget.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" title="The point target" /></p>
<p>The point target indicates a position (shown by the sphere at the base) and
orientation (shown by the arrow) in the scene. To activate or deactivate the
point target, click on the <a href="#point-target-toggle-tool">Point Target Toggle
Tool</a>.</p>
<p>When the point target is active, dragging during a position-based operation
(such as translation) snaps to the target's position in all affected
dimensions. When snapping occurs during one of these operations, both the
<a href="#feedback">feedback</a> and target change to the active target color.</p>
<p>The point target can also be used for instantly moving a model, and it has
other features that let it be used be used for radial layout; see the <a href="#radial-layout-tool">Radial
Layout Tool</a> for details.</p>
<p>The point target can be dragged to any point on a model or on the stage. When
dragging on a model, the target location will snap to vertices of the model's
triangular mesh when close enough to them, based on the current
<a href="#precision">precision</a>. When this occurs, a <em>snap indicator</em> (sphere at the
tip of the target's arrow) will appear.</p>
<p><a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the point target on a model uses the
rectangular bounds of the model instead of its mesh. The target will snap to
the minimum, maximum, and center values of the bounds in each dimension. The
snap indicator sphere will appear when any snapping occurs, and is <a href="#colors">color-coded
by dimension</a>. If snapping occurs in two dimensions, the color will be
the sum of the two dimensions' color. For example, if alt-dragging the point
target on the front (-Y) face of a model's bounds, the indicator will be red
(X) when snapping to the left edge, center, or right edge of the face. It will
be blue (Z) when snapping to the bottom edge, center, or top edge of the
face. It will be magenta (red + blue) when snapping to both at the same
time. You can use this feature to more easily attach the point target to
important points on objects with asymmetric meshes.</p>
<h4 id="edge-target">Edge Target</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/EdgeTarget.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" title="The edge target" /></p>
<p>The edge target indicates a length and orientation in the scene.  To activate
or deactivate the edge target, click on the <a href="#edge-target-toggle-tool">Edge Target Toggle
Tool</a>.</p>
<p>When the edge target is active, dragging during a size-based operation (such as
scaling a model or changing a cylinder or torus diameter) snaps to the target
length. When snapping occurs during one of these operations, both the
<a href="#feedback">feedback</a> and the target change to the active target color.</p>
<p>The edge target can also be used for immediate linear layout. See the <a href="#linear-layout-tool">Linear
Layout Tool</a> for details.</p>
<p>When dragged over a model, the edge target snaps to the nearest edge of that
model's mesh. To see model edges more clearly, you can use the <a href="#show-edges-toggle-tool">Show Edges
Toggle Tool</a> (except on OSX). If the edge target is
dragged from a model to the stage, it retains the length of the last edge it
snapped to. Clicking on the edge target reverses its direction, which is useful
when using the <a href="#linear-layout-tool">Linear Layout Tool</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the edge target on a model uses the
rectangular bounds of the model instead of its mesh; the target will snap to
the nearest edge of the bounds. You can use this feature to easily set the edge
target length to any dimension of a model's bounds.</p>
<h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>
<p>Some of the <a href="#Tools">tools</a> operate on the currently selected model or models.
To select a model, click on it with the mouse or pinch action. The current
editing tool will be attached to it if it is compatible; if not, a different
tool will be attached.</p>
<p>Multiple models can be selected by <a href="#alternate-input-mode">alt-clicking</a> on
them. Alt-clicking an unselected model adds it as a selection, while
alt-clicking a selected model deselects it.</p>
<p>Models that are composed of other models generally hide those child models. For
example, <a href="#combining-models">combined models</a> hide their constituent parts. You
can make the child models visible by selecting them, using either the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree
Panel</a> or the following <a href="../CheatSheet/">keyboard shortcuts</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-DownArrow</code> selects the first child of a composite model.</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-LeftArrow</code> selects the previous sibling of a child or a top-level
  model, wrapping around as necessary.</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-RightArrow</code> selects the next sibling of a child or a top-level model,
  wrapping around as necessary.</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-UpArrow</code> selects the parent of a child model.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <code>Ctrl-A</code> selects all top-level models and <code>Shift-Ctrl-A</code> deselects
everything. You can also deselect everything by clicking on a wall or anywhere
else in the work area that is not interactive. (Keep in mind the stage is
interactive, so it doesn't count.)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/Selection.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;" title="Primary and secondary selections" /></p>
<p>When more than one model is selected, the first selected model is known as the
<em>primary selection</em>, and all other selected models form the <em>secondary
selections</em>. The current editing tool is attached to only the primary
selection. All secondary selections are indicated with a passive blue wireframe
box. Some tools treat the primary and secondary selections differently.</p>
<p>The <a href="#tree-panel">Tree Panel</a> can also be used to see and change the current
selection.</p>
<h3 id="combining-models">Combining Models</h3>
<p>One of the main features of MakerVR is the ability to create new models by
combining models.</p>
<h4 id="csg">CSG</h4>
<p>You can apply any of the three <em>constructive solid geometry (CSG)</em> operations
to two or more models:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Union</em> adds all of the models together.</li>
<li><em>Intersection</em> uses the intersection of all selected models.</li>
<li><em>Difference</em> subtracts all secondary selections from the primary
  selection. Unlike the other two operations, difference is asymmetric, so the
  selection order really matters.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/CSGDifference.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/CSGIntersection.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/CSGUnion.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/CSGOperands.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" /></p>
<p>These images show the original operand models, a box and a cylinder, and the
resulting CSG union, intersection, and difference (cylinder subtracted from the
box).</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="#clip-tool">Clip Tool</a> may also be helpful for simpler cases of
geometric editing.</p>
<h4 id="convex-hull">Convex Hull</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/HullCapsule.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/HullSpheres.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" /></p>
<p>Another way to combine models is the <em>convex hull</em> operation, which creates a
new model from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">3D convex hull</a>
of all selected models. This can be used to easily create different shapes. For
example, here is an easy way to create a capsule by applying the hull operation
to two spheres.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/HullDisk.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/HullTorus.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;margin:2px;" /></p>
<p>The hull operation also can be useful to apply to a single model, if the model
is not already convex. Here's an example of creating a rounded disk as the hull
of a torus.</p>
<h4 id="some-patience-required">Some Patience Required</h4>
<p>MakerVR uses the <a href="https://www.cgal.org/">CGAL library</a> to compute the
combinations of objects. Even though this library is very powerful, robust, and
well-optimized, it can still take some time to compute the results in complex
cases. This work is performed in a separate thread so that the application is
not frozen while it happens. While the computation is active, the combined
model may be displayed as a 3D hourglass and the mouse cursor (visible when not
in VR mode) will also be an hourglass.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>Finally! We get to the actual tools. As mentioned <a href="#the-work-area">previously</a>,
the tools are represented by 3D icons organized into shelves in the work area.</p>
<p>There are four basic types of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools that perform an immediate action, such as creating a cylinder.</li>
<li>Tools that toggle some sort of mode.</li>
<li>Tools that attach to the selected model and that provide some interactive
  features you can click or drag to edit some aspect of those models.</li>
<li>Tools that bring up some sort of <a href="#gui-panels">GUI panel</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Icons for tools that are disabled due to the current program state are rendered
as dark. Active icons, such as the current attached tool or toggles in the "on"
state, are rendered using the active color, which is reddish.</p>
<p>In case it wasn't obvious, you can use the mouse or laser/pinch to activate an
enabled tool. You can switch to a different enabled tool for the <a href="#selection">primary
selection</a> with the next-tool shortcut (<code>]</code> key or Right on either
VR controller trackpad) or the previous-tool shortcut (<code>[</code> key or Left on
either trackpad).</p>
<h3 id="model-creation-shelf">Model Creation Shelf</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ModelCreationShelf.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>This shelf is at the bottom on the left of the work area. It has icons for the
four primitive objects that can be created: <em>box</em>, <em>cylinder</em>, <em>sphere</em>, and
<em>torus</em>. Clicking on any of these icons creates a new instance of the
corresponding shape, which drops in from above.</p>
<p>If the <a href="#point-target">point target</a> is active (visible), any new model will be
placed with its bottom center point at the base of the point target, with the
model's "up" direction aligned with the point target's direction arrow.</p>
<p>The fifth icon (capital 'T') creates extruded 3D text. Clicking this brings up
the <a href="#text-panel">Text Panel</a> to let you specify the text and font. If a single
text model is selected, the Text Panel will not create a new model; it will
instead be used to modify the selected text model.</p>
<p>The right-most icon is used to import a model from a file. Clicking this icon
opens a <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a> that lets you choose a file to import. Right
now the only supported format is STL (text or binary), which is the standard
for most 3D printer software. The default directory for this panel can be
changed in the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a>.</p>
<p>If an imported model is selected and you click on the Import Model icon, it
asks if you want to re-import the model. This can be useful when you are using
an external program to edit the model and want to update it inside MakerVR.
Note that an STL file must define a closed (watertight) 3D model for it to be
imported successfully. An invalid model will be shown as a gray tetrahedron; it
will remain that way until you re-import a version that is valid.</p>
<h3 id="model-editing-shelves">Model Editing Shelves</h3>
<p>The two shelves above the <a href="#model-creation-shelf">Model Creation Shelf</a> contain
the model editing Tools. These are the main interactive gizmos that let you
modify different aspects of models.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="clip-tool">Clip Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ClipTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Clip Tool allows you to remove parts of models with one or more clipping
planes. This tool has three interactive parts:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ClipToolInactive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>A translucent quadrilateral representing the clipping plane. Clicking this
  quadrilateral activates the tool to clip the selected model(s).</li>
<li>An arrow indicating the normal to the clipping plane. The part of the
  selected model(s) on the side of the plane with the normal is what will be
  clipped away when the plane is clicked. Dragging the arrow lets you
  reposition the plane along the normal.</li>
<li>A translucent sphere that lets you change the orientation of the clipping
  plane.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ClipToolClipped.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Clipping a model for the first time replaces it with a new, clipped version of
the model. Additional clipping planes can be applied to the same clipped
model. When the Clip Tool is attached to a clipped model, it aligns itself with
the most recent clipping plane applied to that model.</p>
<p>Translating the plane by dragging the arrow is limited by the extents of the
primary model; it will not let you move the plane completely off this model.
The plane will snap to the <a href="#point-target">point target location</a> if the target
is active or to the center of the primary selection. The plane will change
color to the target color when snapped to either point.
<a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the arrow deactivates any snapping.</p>
<p>When rotating the plane by dragging the sphere, the plane normal will snap to
the <a href="#point-target">point target direction</a> if the target is active or to any
of the principal axes. If the <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle-tool">Axis-Aligned Toggle
Tool</a> is active, the principal axes of the stage are
used; otherwise, the local axes of the primary model are used. The plane will
change color when snapped to either the target color or the <a href="#colors">color
corresponding to a principal axis</a>.
<a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-dragging</a> the sphere deactivates any snapping.</p>
<p>When interacting (either translating or rotating), all selected objects will be
clipped in real time to show what will happen when the plane is clicked. The
real-time clipping stops when interaction ends.</p>
<p>Grip-dragging works for both translation and rotation. If the controller is
oriented so that the <a href="#interaction">hover guide</a> attached to the controller is
nearly parallel to the plane normal arrow, grip-dragging will translate the
plane along the normal based on the controller position. Otherwise,
grip-dragging will rotate the plane based on the controller orientation.
Snapping occurs as above unless <a href="#alternate-input-mode">alt-dragging</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="color-tool">Color Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ColorTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/ColorToolActive.jpg" style="height:120px;float:right;margin:2px;" /></p>
<p>The Color Tool edits the color of all selected models. It is placed above the
primary selection. The disc in the center of the tool shows the current color
of the primary selection, as does the small marker in the outer ring. Clicking
or dragging anywhere in the ring moves the marker and changes the color of all
selected models. Grip-dragging works as well; the relative position of the
controller is used to move the marker around the ring.</p>
<p>Colors have no real effect on the 3D-printed model, but they can be used to
distinguish different parts while editing. Or just to make things look nicer.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="complexity-tool">Complexity Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ComplexityTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Complexity Tool appears above the primary selection and changes the number
of triangles used to represent all selected primitive objects. It has no effect
on boxes or imported models, but does work on spheres, cylinders, tori, and
text objects.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/HighComplexity.jpg" style="height:120px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/LowComplexity.jpg" style="height:120px;float:right;margin:2px;" /></p>
<p>Dragging the slider handle on the Complexity Tool updates the number of
triangles used for all affected selected models. Grip-dragging also works; the
relative position of the controller moves the handle. These images show two
positions of the handle applied to a cylinder's complexity.</p>
<p>The Complexity Tool will be disabled if the primary selection is a type (such
as a box) that cannot have its complexity modified. If the primary selection is
a <a href="#profile-tool">profiled model</a> or <a href="#combining-models">combined model</a>, you
cannot modify its complexity directly is the primary selection. You can <a href="#selection">select
child models</a> of one of these to modify its complexity; the parent
model will update appropriately when its children are no longer selected.</p>
<p>Note that you can use complexity to create variations of models. The lowest
complexity cylinder is a triangular prism, and the lowest complexity sphere is
an octohedron. You can use the <a href="#show-edges-toggle-tool">Show Edges Toggle
Tool</a> to see the triangle edges more clearly as in
these images (except on OSX).</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="cylinder-tool">Cylinder Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/CylinderTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Cylinder Tool is enabled when a primitive cylinder model is the primary
selection. It allows the top and bottom radii of the cylinder to be changed to
create cones or truncated cones.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/CylinderToolActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The tool consists of a double-ended slider at the top and bottom. The pair of
handles on each slider work symmetrically. The radius being modified follows
the current <a href="#precision">precision</a> setting and also snaps to the current <a href="#edge-target">edge
target length</a> if the target is active. <a href="#feedback">Feedback</a>
shows the current radius value during a drag.</p>
<p>Grip-dragging also may be used to modify either radius. A <a href="#interaction">hover
guide</a> attached to each controller shows which slider handle will
be activated when the grip button is pressed. The relative position of the
controller chooses the top or bottom radius.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="mirror-tool">Mirror Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/MirrorTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Mirror Tool mirrors selected models across a plane. When the tool is
active, it adds 3 color-coded orthogonal planes to the primary selection.
Clicking on any of the planes mirrors the model across it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/MirrorToolActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The planes always pass through the center of the primary selection.  If
multiple models are selected, secondary selections are mirrored across the same
planes, meaning that they will move to the opposite side of the plane if they
are not also bisected by the plane. However,
<a href="#alternate-input-mode">alt-clicking</a> on a plane causes all models to be
mirrored in place as if the plane passed through all of their centers.</p>
<p>The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle-tool">Axis-Aligned Toggle Tool</a> affects how the
Mirror Tool is attached to the primary selection when the primary selection has
been rotated. If the toggle is active, then the planes will always be aligned
with the cartesian planes of the stage, rather than with the local coordinates
of the primary selection.</p>
<p>Applying the Mirror Tool to a model creates a new model. The original model
becomes a child of the mirrored model; you can see it in the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree
Panel</a> and <a href="#selection">select it</a> if you want to modify it.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="profile-tool">Profile Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Profile Tool lets you edit the edge profile of selected models to create
various effects such as beveling, chamfering, or rounding. The profile change
is applied to edges of all selected models.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolCreateButton.jpg" style="height:180px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>If you activate the Profile Tool for a model that has not yet had its edge
profile modified, the tool brings up a <a href="#gui-panels">GUI panel</a> with a single
button that lets you create a default profile for the model. Clicking this
button will apply the default profile to the model to create a bevel. If
multiple models are selected, the <code>Create Profile</code> button will appear only if
at least one of the models does not already have edge profiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  <!-- Need some vertical space for the image here -->
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolDefaultProfile.jpg" style="height:180px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>If all selected models have edge profiles, or if you click the <code>Create Profile</code>
button, the Profile Tool switches to editing mode and shows the current profile
in the panel above the primary selection. This image shows the default profile
initially created for a model, creating a simple bevel on all edges.</p>
<p>The line drawn in the panel represents the profile that will be applied to each
edge of the selected Models. The upper-right corner is where the edge is
located; the default profile creates a bevel that cuts off the top-right half
of the edge as can be seen in the beveled cube in the above image.</p>
<p>The upper-left and lower-right points of the profile are at fixed locations and
are colored blue to indicate this. You can add new points between them, move
those points around, and delete points, as described below. The selected Models
update as the profile is edited.</p>
<h5 id="editing-the-profile-with-mouse-or-pinch">Editing the Profile with Mouse or Pinch</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolDeleteBox.jpg" style="height:120px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Clicking anywhere on or near the profile line (except very close to an existing
point) creates a new interior point at that spot. New points are rendered the
same way as other interactive objects to indicate that they are movable.
Dragging on or near the line (instead of clicking) creates a new point and
immediately starts dragging it. Dragging an existing interior point moves it;
when you do this, a box with an "X" in it appears to allow you to delete the
point by dragging it over that box, as illustrated here.</p>
<h5 id="editing-the-profile-with-grip-drag">Editing the Profile with Grip Drag</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolGripHighlightMidpoint.jpg" style="height:160px;float:right;margin:2px" />
<img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolGripHighlightPoint.jpg" style="height:160px;float:right;margin:2px" /></p>
<p>When in <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR mode or hybrid mode</a>, holding either VR
controller so that the <a href="#interaction">hover guide</a> points forward (toward the
sheet) will highlight all movable points and also the midpoint of each profile
line segment, whichever is closest to the current relative controller
position. The midpoint is rendered as a blue square, as shown here. When a
point is highlighted, grip dragging moves that point. When a midpoint square is
highlighted, grip dragging creates a new point along that segment and starts
dragging it. As in the mouse/pinch case, a delete box with an "X" appears to
allow points to be removed.</p>
<h5 id="profile-scaling">Profile Scaling</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolScalingLarge.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;margin:2px;" />
<img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolScalingSmall.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;margin:2px;" /></p>
<p>The slider at the bottom of the panel allows you to scale the size of the
profile as it is applied to edges without having to readjust any points. For
example, you can create a rounding profile and change the radius by adjusting
the slider as shown here.</p>
<h5 id="maximum-angle">Maximum Angle</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ProfileToolMaxAngle.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The slider on the right of the sheet allows you to change the maximum edge
angle, from 0 to 180 degrees. This determines which edges are affected by the
tool. For example, suppose you have a cylinder and want to apply the profile to
just the edges forming the top and bottom faces, as shown here. These edges
form 90 degree angles, so as long as the maximum angle is at least 90, they
will have the profile applied. The edges between faces forming the sides are
typically greater than 90 degrees (unless the cylinder has very low
<a href="#complexity-tool">complexity</a>); as long as the maximum angle is smaller than
that angle, profiles will not be applied to those edges.  The default is 120
degrees.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="rotation-tool">Rotation Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/RotationTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Rotation Tool lets you rotate selected models. It has 3 color-coded rings
for rotating about the cartesian axes and a central sphere for doing free
spherical rotation. The rotation angle follows the current
<a href="#precision">precision</a> setting and also snaps to the current <a href="#point-target">point target
direction</a>.</p>
<p>Color-coded <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> shows the current rotation angle or angles
during a drag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/RotationToolActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Rotation always takes place about the center of the primary selection.  If
multiple models are selected, secondary selections are rotated around the same
point, meaning that they revolve around the primary selection. However,
<a href="#alternate-input-mode">alt-dragging</a> the tool causes all models to be rotated
in place about their own centers.</p>
<p>The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle-tool">Axis-Aligned Toggle Tool</a> affects how the
Rotation Tool is attached to the primary selection. If the toggle is active, then
the rings will always be aligned with the cartesian planes of the stage,
rather than with the local coordinates of the primary selection.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/RotationToolActiveVR.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Grip-dragging uses the orientation of the VR controller to define the
rotation. A <a href="#interaction">hover guide</a> attached to each controller hand
indicates what action will be performed. Note that the hover guide for rotation
points forward from the hand, unlike most other hover guides.  When the ring on
the guide is close to aligning with any of the axis rings on the Rotation Tool,
the guide will show a color-coded connection to that ring. (In the picture
here, the ring is close to aligning with the red X-axis rotation ring of the
Rotation Tool.) In any other orientation, the guide will show a neutral-color
connection to the center sphere. If a ring is hovered, pressing the grip button
and rotating the controller ring around the guide axis will rotate the model(s)
the same way. When no ring is selected, the model(s) will be free rotated to
match the controller orientation.</p>

<h4 id="scale-tool">Scale Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ScaleTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Scale Tool lets you change the size of selected models. It has several
double-ended sliders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three sliders aligned with the coordinate axes of the primary model. These
  scale nonuniformly in one dimension.</li>
<li>Eight sliders passing diagonally through edge centers. These scale
  nonuniformly in two dimensions.</li>
<li>Four sliders passing diagonally through the corners of the primary
  model. These scale uniformly in all three dimensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any dimension being scaled follows the current <a href="#precision">precision</a> and
snaps to the current <a href="#edge-target">edge target length</a> if the edge target is
active. Color-coded <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> shows the current relevant dimension
or dimensions of the primary selection during a drag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ScaleToolActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>There are two scaling modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Asymmetric</em> scaling resizes the model about the opposite point. That is,
  when you drag a slider handle, the handle on the other end stays fixed. This
  is the default scaling mode when dragging a handle.</li>
<li><em>Symmetric</em> scaling resizes the model about its center. When dragging a
  slider handle in this mode, the handle on the opposite side moves the same
  amount in the other direction. <a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-dragging</a> a
  slider handle performs symmetric scaling.</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiple models are selected, all secondary selections are scaled in place
in their local orientations by corresponding ratios. The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle-tool">Axis-Aligned Toggle
Tool</a> has no effect on the Scale Tool, since it
might cause confusing shearing to occur.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ScaleToolActiveVR.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Grip-dragging uses the orientation of the VR controller to select a slider
handle to activate. A <a href="#interaction">hover guide</a> attached to each controller
hand shows the direction that needs to align with the slider to activate its
handle. When the guide is close enough to being aligned with a slider, the
guide will show a color-coded (neutral if not a 1-dimension slider) connection
to the closest handle of that slider. When a handle is highlighted in this
manner, pressing the grip button and moving the controller along the slider
direction scales the model(s).</p>

<h4 id="torus-tool">Torus Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TorusTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Torus Tool is enabled when a primitive torus model is the primary
selection. It allows the inner and outer diameters of the torus to be</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TorusToolActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The tool consists of two double-ended sliders, one horizontal and one
vertical. The horizontal slider changes the outer diameter, and the vertical
slider changes the inner diameter. The handles operate symmetrically. The
diameter being modified follows the current <a href="#precision">precision</a> setting and
also snaps to the current <a href="#edge-target">edge target length</a> if the target is
active. <a href="#feedback">Feedback</a> shows both diameter values during a drag.</p>
<p>Note that if the inner diameter is increased too much, the outer diameter will
be increased as well to keep the torus from intersecting itself. Reducing the
inner diameter during the same drag operation will reduce the outer diameter as
well up to its previous size.</p>
<p>Grip-dragging also may be used to modify either diameter. A <a href="#interaction">hover
guide</a> attached to each controller shows which slider handle will
be activated when the grip button is pressed. The relative orientation
(horizontal or vertical) of the controller and guide chooses the outer or inner
diameter.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="translation-tool">Translation Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TranslationTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TranslationToolActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Translation Tool lets you change the position of selected models. It adds a
double-ended slider along each of the cartesian axes. Dragging the handle at
either end translates all selected models along the corresponding axis.
Translation offsets follow the current <a href="#precision">precision</a> setting. The
translation also snaps to the current <a href="#point-target">point target location</a> if
the target is active; snapping is done when the minimum, center, or maximum
value of the primary model in the translated dimension is aligned with the
target position. Color-coded <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> shows the current
translation amount during a drag.</p>
<p>The <a href="#axis-aligned-toggle-tool">Axis-Aligned Toggle Tool</a> affects how the
Translation Tool is attached to the primary selection. If the toggle is active,
then the sliders will always be aligned with the cartesian axes of the stage,
rather than with the local coordinates of the primary selection.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TranslationToolActiveVR.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Grip-dragging uses the orientation of the VR controller to select a slider
handle to activate. A <a href="#interaction">hover guide</a> attached to each controller
hand shows the direction that needs to align with the slider to activate its
handle. When the guide is close enough to being aligned with a slider, the
guide will show a color-coded connection to the closest handle of that
slider. When a handle is highlighted in this manner, pressing the grip button
and moving the controller along the slider direction translates the model(s)
along the axis in either direction (pull or push).</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../img/CombiningShelf.jpg" style="height:100px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>This shelf is at the top on the left of the work area. It has icons for
different operations that <a href="combining-models">combine models in the scene</a>.</p>
<p>The first three icons represent the three supported <a href="#csg">CSG</a> operations,
<em>difference</em>, <em>intersection</em>, and <em>union</em>.  These icons are enabled when two or
more models are selected. Clicking on any of the icons creates the
corresponding CSG combination of the selected models.  If a single CSG model is
selected, clicking on either of the two enabled CSG icons changes the operation
for that model to the corresponding one.</p>
<p>The last icon is for the <a href="#convex-hull">Convex Hull</a> operation. This is enabled
when anything is selected, since it can be useful to apply to a single model.</p>
<p>When any of these operations is applied, the original models become children of
the combined model; you can see the tree hierarchy in the <a href="#tree-panel">Tree
Panel</a>. You can also <a href="#selection">select the children</a> if you want

<p>The Undo Tool undoes the last operation performed that modified the scene in
some way. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any change to a model or models.</li>
<li>Changing the position or any other feature of either of the
  <a href="#targets">targets</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions that are <em>not</em> considered changes and are therefore not undoable
include:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../img/PasteIntoTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Paste Into Tool can be used to paste models from the clipboard as children
of the selected model, as long as that model is one that can have children.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a <a href="#csg">CSG</a> union model and you want to add another
piece (say, a box) to it, you can cut or copy the box (in the correct position,
of course), select the CSG union, and click the Paste Into Tool. The box will
be added as a child of the union.</p>

<h4 id="point-target-toggle-tool">Point Target Toggle Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/PointTargetToggleTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Point Target Toggle Tool toggles the visibility of the <a href="#point-target">point
target</a>. When the point target is made visible for the first
time, it is placed at the center of the stage. After it is dragged to any other
location, it stays there until dragged again.</p>
<p>If the target is enabled but is not visible, it may be obscured by models. You

<h4 id="linear-layout-tool">Linear Layout Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/LinearLayoutTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Linear Layout Tool can be used to lay out two or more models along a line.
The length and orientation of the <a href="#edge-target">edge target</a> will be used to
lay out the centers of all secondary selections relative to the primary
selection.</p>
<p>It may be useful to create a temporary model with the correct size as a layout
aid. For example, suppose you want to lay out 3 models along the X direction
with 6cm between their centers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a box and scale it so that it is 6cm in size in X (using 1cm
  <a href="#precision">precision</a>).</li>
<li>Activate the edge target and drag it onto one of the box edges in the X
  direction. The target will then be exactly 6cm in length and lie along the X
  axis. Click on the edge target to flip it if it is pointing in the wrong
  direction.</li>
<li>Delete the box if you no longer need it.</li>
<li>Select the primary selection - the one that will not move.</li>
<li><a href="#selection">Alt-select</a> the other models to lay out, in order.</li>
<li>Click on the Linear Layout Tool.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="radial-layout-tool">Radial Layout Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/RadialLayoutTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Radial Layout Tool can be used to lay out models along a circle or circular
arc. All of the parameters of the layout are specified using the <a href="#point-target">point
target</a>.</p>
<p>The point target has a location (where the sphere is) and a direction (where
the arrow is pointing). If only one model is selected and the Radial Layout
Tool is clicked, the bottom center of the model will be moved to the target
location and its "up" direction will be aligned with the target direction.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/PointTargetRadius.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>If two or more models are selected, clicking on the Radial Layout Tool will lay
them out along a circle or arc. To set this up, you can use some extra features
of the point target. To use them, drag the ring of the target to make it
larger. As you do this, you will see [feedback][#feedback] above the arrow
showing the current diameter of the ring. This corresponds to the diameter of
the circle or arc for your layout. The radius follows the current
<a href="#precision">precision</a> setting.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/PointTargetRadiusActive.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>Intersecting the ring are two spokes, one green and one red. These are used to
modify the starting and ending angles for layout, respectively. If you drag the
green (starting) spoke, both spokes rotate around the circle. If you drag the
red (ending) spoke, only the red spoke moves. The arc connecting the spokes
shows the direction of the layout (green to red). If you want to reverse the
direction, drag the red spoke past the green one in the desired direction. As
you drag either spoke, color-coded feedback shows the angle of each spoke and
the subtended layout angle.  Note that the spoke angles follow the current
<a href="#precision">precision</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have set up the point target with the correct position, orientation,
radius, and angles, clicking on the Radial Layout Tool will position all
selected models with their bottom centers along the circle or arc. The
selection order determines the order in which they are laid out: the primary
selection will be at the start angle, and the last-selected model will be at
the end angle.</p>
<p>When you are done, you can put the spokes back together and drag the radius
down to its tiny state.</p>

<h4 id="axis-aligned-toggle-tool">Axis-Aligned Toggle Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/AxisAlignedToggleTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>The Axis-Aligned Toggle Tool toggles whether certain tools operate in the
selected model's local coordinates or in stage coordinates. For example, if a
model has been rotated to an arbitrary orientation and you want to move it 5cm
to the right in the scene, you can turn on axis-alignment and the <a href="#translation-tool">Translation
Tool</a> will be oriented with the stage, not the model.</p>
<p>This toggle affects the following interactive tools:</p>

<h4 id="inspect-selection-tool">Inspect Selection Tool</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/InspectorTool.jpg" style="height:80px;float:left;margin-right:8px;" /></p>
<p>MakerVR provides a special <em>inspector</em> mode that lets you easily examine a
model from all directions. To inspect a model, select it as the primary
selection, and click on the Inspect Selection Tool to turn it on.  Another
shortcut to this mode is to long-press (more than a half-second or so) either
the mouse or laser pointer/pinch on a model. There is also a <a href="../CheatSheet/">keyboard
shortcut</a>.</p>
<p>When in <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">VR mode</a> (headset on), the model will be
attached to the controller in the hand that initiated the inspection. You can
move and turn your hand around to see the model from all angles.</p>
<p>When in <a href="#vr-and-non-vr-modes">conventional mode or hybrid mode</a>, the model
will be enlarged and placed in the middle of the application window. In
conventional mode, moving the mouse (no need to click) rotates the model. In
hybrid mode, if inspector mode was initiated with the mouse, it is the same as
conventional mode, but if inspector mode was initiated with a controller, that
controller rotates the model as in VR mode.</p>
<p>Any key, mouse click, or controller button press exits inspector mode.</p>

<h2 id="tree-panel">Tree Panel</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TreePanel.jpg" style="height:160px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Tree Panel is the framed board on the back wall. It has multiple uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying a list of all models in the scene, including their tree structure
  and current status.</li>
<li>Selecting models.</li>
<li>Toggling model visibility.</li>
<li>Editing model names.</li>
<li>Changing order of models.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="session-name-and-status">Session Name and Status</h3>
<p>The current name of the session being edited is shown at the top of the
panel. If the session has not yet been saved with a name, it will show as
<code>&lt;Untitled&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If the session has been modified since it was loaded, there will be a
modification string within square brackets after the session name.  This string
may contain the following characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>An asterisk (<code>'*'</code>) indicates that one or more models has been created or
  modified and not undone.</li>
<li>An exclamation point (<code>'!'</code>) indicates that the session state (such as edge
  visibility or bound volume visibility) has changed.</li>
<li>A plus sign (<code>'+'</code>) indicates that the set of commands in the session file
  has changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a session can be saved if any of these symbols appears. For example,
if you make changes to models and then undo back to their original state, there
will be no asterisk, but the plus sign lets you know that the session can still
be saved. The session state is also saved, so changing any allows you to save
as well.</p>
<h3 id="model-names">Model Names</h3>
<p>Each row under the top row of the panel represents a model in the scene. Any
model that has children will show those children as indented names under its
name. There will also be a triangle that you can click or pinch to collapse or
expand the children. Clicking on a model name <a href="#selecting-models">selects that
model</a>.</p>
<h3 id="text-colors">Text Colors</h3>
<p>Each model displayed in the Tree Panel is shown with its name in color-coded
text to indicate its status:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="color:rgb(212,20,20)">primary selection is red</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(0,0,254)">secondary selections are blue</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(128,10,117)">models with visibility off are
  purple</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(102,102,102)">children hidden because their
  parents are visible are gray</span>.</li>
<li>All <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">other models are black</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="font-size">Font Size</h3>
<p>The slider on the right of the Tree Panel changes the font size of the text and
the sizes of all of the buttons.  This can be useful if you have a lot of
models and want to see more of them or to use <a href="#selecting-models">rectangle
selection</a> on more names.</p>
<h3 id="changing-visibility">Changing Visibility</h3>
<p>Each model name in the Tree Panel has a little eye icon to its left. Clicking
this icon toggles the visibility of the corresponding model in the scene.</p>
<p>There is also an eye icon next to the session name at the top. If any model is
currently hidden, clicking this will show all models. Otherwise, it will hide
all models.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-models">Selecting Models</h3>
<p>Clicking with the mouse or pinch on a model name selects it as the primary
selection. <a href="#alternate-input-mode">Alt-clicking</a> on a model name toggles its
selection status.</p>
<p>You can also use the mouse or pinch to drag out a selection rectangle in the
panel. All model names intersected by the rectangle will be selected. <a href="#reordering-models">Changing
the order of names</a> may help in some cases.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot have both a parent and child model selected at the same
tome. Allowing this would be horrendous.</p>

<p>MakerVR creates names for new models using the type of model and a numerical
suffix to guarantee uniqueness. You can use the edit

button on the top right of the panel to bring up a text editing field that lets
you <a href="#text-input">edit</a> the current name of the model. It will not let you
create a duplicate name.</p>
<h3 id="reordering-models">Reordering Models</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/MoveUpDown.jpg" style="height:64px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>There are some cases where the order of models in the Tree Panel matters. One
is when you want to use <a href="#selecting-models">rectangle selection</a> to select some
range of models. Another is when the order of children within a parent matters,
such as within a <a href="#csg">CSG difference</a>. In these cases the move-up and
move-down buttons can be used to move the primary selection up and down in the
list. Note that if the primary selection is a child, it can only be moved up
and down within its parent.</p>
<h2 id="gui-panels">GUI Panels</h2>
<p>MakerVR uses a few conventional user interface panels. They are always aligned
with the XZ-plane over the center of the stage. Most panels have an interactive
handle on each edge that allows you to move the sheet if it is obscuring
anything. Some panels also have interactive sphere handles in the corners that
allow you to resize them. (For example the panel used by the <a href="#profile-tool">Profile
Tool</a> lets you resize the panel to make the profile editing area
larger or smaller.)</p>
<p>All of the panel handles respond to grip-dragging; the orientation of a
controller determines which handle will be used. For example, if the <a href="#interaction">hover
guide</a> for the right controller is close to parallel to the X
axis, it will highlight the move handle on the right side, so you can grip-drag
it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/PanelColors.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>All interactive buttons highlight when hovered with the mouse or laser
  pointer. A highlighted button will be shown with a blue background.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation between buttons is possible with up, down, left, and
  right arrows and also tab and shift-tab. The current keyboard-focused button
  is shown with a green background. If nothing is shown with focus, hitting the
  tab key should focus on the first button.</li>
<li>Disabled buttons are dark gray.</li>
<li>Clicking on a button with the mouse or pinch action activates it.</li>
<li>Pressing enter on the keyboard with a button focused activates it.</li>
<li>Pressing the escape key always cancels whatever the panel is doing and
  dismisses it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some panels contain scrolling areas when their contents are too large to
fit. You can scroll a panel using the scrollbar on the right (mouse only),
dragging the contents up or down (mouse only), or by pressing the Up or Down
trackpad buttons on a VR controller.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="session-panel">Session Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/SessionPanel.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Session Panel is shown when the application starts and can also be brought
up at any time by clicking on the <a href="#session-panel-tool">Session Panel Tool</a>.
This panel is used to start, save, and load sessions. Sessions are saved as
text files with an <code>".mvr"</code> (MakerVR) extension. Feel free to look at and edit
the session files if that's your thing.</p>
<p>The Session Panel has the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Continue previous/current session</code>. When the application starts, this choice
  will be enabled if your previous session was saved with a name (which will
  appear here in parentheses). Click this to resume working in that session. If
  the panel is invoked during a session, clicking this button will act as if
  nothing happened.</li>
<li><code>Load session file</code>. This can be used to load a different session file with
  the <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a>. If you use this during a session, you will be
  informed if you made any changes that you might want to save.</li>
<li><code>Start new session</code>. This resets everything to empty and starts a new,
  unnamed session. If you use this during a session, you will be informed if
  you made any changes that you might want to save.</li>
<li><code>Save session</code>. If your session is already named, this will be enabled to
  save it again if you made any changes.</li>
<li><code>Save session as</code>. This lets you save your session with a different name
  using the <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a>.</li>
<li><code>Export Selection</code>. The application would be pretty useless if there is no
  way to send the model information to a 3D printer, right? This button lets
  you export the selected model(s) to a file, using a <a href="#file-panel">File
  Panel</a>. The File Panel contains a dropdown that allows you to
  select the desired format (text or binary STL).</li>
<li><code>Help</code> (question mark icon at top left). Brings up the <a href="#help-panel">Help
  Panel</a>. Dismissing the Help Panel returns to the Session Panel.</li>
<li><code>Settings</code> (gear icon at top right). Brings up the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
  Panel</a>. Dismissing the Settings Panel returns to the Session
  Panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default directories for session files and STL files are both stored as user
settings and can be modified with the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="settings-panel">Settings Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/SettingsPanel.jpg" style="height:240px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Settings Panel lets you modify all user settings that are saved between
sessions. The location of the saved setting is defined by <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html">Unity
PlayerPrefs</a>.</p>
<h4 id="default-directories">Default Directories</h4>
<p>The first three items are the default directories for
<a href="#session-panel">sessions</a>, <a href="#model-creation-shelf">STL import</a>, and <a href="#session-panel">STL
export</a>. Each of these lets you <a href="#text-input">type in</a> the
directory or click on the <code>Browse</code> button to open a <a href="#file-panel">File Panel</a>
for that item.</p>
<h4 id="tooltip-delay">Tooltip Delay</h4>
<p>Next is a slider to adjust the time it takes for <a href="#tooltips">tooltips</a> to
appear when hovering the mouse or laser pointer over an interactive object.
Values are in seconds, from 0 at the left to 5 at the right. Setting this to 0
disables tooltips completely.</p>
<h4 id="build-volume-size">Build Volume Size</h4>
<p>Next are three text input fields that allow you to specify the build volume
size in all three dimensions, using the current
<a href="#coordinate-system-and-units">units</a>. See the <a href="#build-volume-toggle-tool">Build Volume Toggle
Tool</a></p>
<h4 id="unit-conversion">Unit Conversion</h4>
<p>Next are two sets of dropdowns allowing conversion of units on model import and
export. Use of these is explained in the section on <a href="#coordinate-system-and-units">Coordinate System and
Units</a>.</p>
<h4 id="radial-menus">Radial Menus</h4>
<p>Last is a button that brings up the <a href="#radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor
Panel</a>, which allows you to edit the <a href="#interaction">radial
menus</a>,</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="info-panel">Info Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/InfoPanel.jpg" style="height:180px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Info Panel shows information about all selected models, including the
number of vertices, number of triangles, and size in all three dimensions. If
any model has an invalid mesh, this is noted, along with the reason it is
considered invalid.</p>
<p>The info area in the panel will contain scroll bars if there is more text than
will fit. Also note that the Info Panel has resize handles (spheres) in the
corners to change its size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  <!-- Need some vertical space for the image here --></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="help-panel">Help Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/HelpPanel.jpg" style="height:140px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Help Panel shows some brief "about" text including the current application
version.  Below that are two buttons that should bring up this user guide or
the <a href="../CheatSheet/">Cheat Sheet</a> for reference in your default browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  <!-- Need some vertical space for the image here -->
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/RadialMenuEditorPanel.jpg" style="height:256px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>This panel can be opened from the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings Panel</a> to edit the
<a href="#interaction">radial menus</a>. The radio buttons in the box at the top let you
choose one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Use Independent Settings</code>: The buttons defined for each controller are used
  for that controller.</li>
<li><code>Use Left Settings for Both</code>: The buttons defined for the left controller are
  used for both controllers.</li>
<li><code>Use Right Settings for Both</code>: The buttons defined for the right controller
  are used for both controllers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set the number of buttons to use on a controller to 1, 2, 4, or 8. The
menu diagram updates to reflect the current number. Clicking on any button in
the diagram brings up the <a href="#action-panel">Action Panel</a> to let you choose the
action attached to that button. Each action is indicated by a horribly-designed
2D icon that will show up in the radial menu diagram and in the actual radial
menu as well. The null icon (<img alt="" src="../img/MINone.png" style="height:32px;" />) means
that no action is bound to a button.</p>
<p>You can activate a radial menu by pressing the menu button on a controller.
Radial menus are always available in conventional mode via <a href="../CheatSheet/">keyboard
shortcuts</a> for use with the mouse.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="action-panel">Action Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/ActionPanel.jpg" style="height:256px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Action Panel is used by the <a href="#radial-menu-editor-panel">Radial Menu Editor
Panel</a> to select the action associated with a radial
menu button. It presents a scrolling list of actions. You can scroll the panel
using the scrollbar on the right (mouse or pinch), dragging the contents up or
down (mouse or pinch), by pressing the Up or Down trackpad buttons on a VR
controller, or by using a scroll wheel. You can also resize the panel with the
resize handles (spheres) in the corners.</p>
<p>The actions in the panel are organized roughly by shelf or sections of this
User Guide. The action that is currently bound to the button being modified is
marked as <code>[CURRENT]</code>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../CheatSheet/">Cheat Sheet</a> for a list of all actions and their
associated icons.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="file-panel">File Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/FilePanel.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The File Panel is used by the <a href="#session-panel">Session Panel</a>, the <a href="#settings-panel">Settings
Panel</a>, and the <a href="#model-creation-shelf">Import Tool</a> when a
directory or file needs to be chosen.  It works pretty much like a standard
file browser. The four buttons at the top go to the previous directory (if
any), the next directory (if you went to the previous one), one directory up,
or your home directory. A button at the bottom lets you see hidden files and
directories (operating-system-specific).</p>
<p>The scrolling list is color coded for directories and files, with directories
listed first. You can scroll the list using the scrollbar on the right (mouse
only), dragging the contents up or down (mouse only), or by pressing the Up or
Down trackpad buttons on a VR controller.</p>
<p>The File Format dropdown at the top right is used for selecting a format when
<a href="#session-panel">exporting files</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="text-panel">Text Panel</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/TextPanel.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;" /></p>
<p>The Text Panel is brought up by the text icon on the <a href="#model-creation-shelf">Model Creation
Shelf</a> to create or modify extruded 3D text. It lets you
specify the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text string.</li>
<li>Font family. You can select from the dropdown list containing all available
  font families.</li>
<li>Font style. This dropdown lets you select from the styles available for the
  currently-selected family.</li>
<li>Character spacing (slider). This factor multiplies the spacing between
  individual characters to move them closer together or further apart. The
  default is 1, which is the spacing defined by the font.</li>
</ul>
<p>3D text is laid out by default at the origin along the X axis, extruded 2 units
along the +Z (up) direction. It is sized by default so that the characters are
approximately 4 units in the Y dimension. The <a href="#scale-tool">Scale Tool</a> can be
used to change the size, and the <a href="#complexity-tool">Complexity Tool</a> can be
used to change how finely the characters are tessellated into triangles.</p>
<p>The font family dropdown can contain many items, so it is important to know
that the trackpad up/down buttons can be used to scroll a dropdown list when
using VR controllers. A scroll wheel works in conventional mode.</p>
<h2 id="quirks">Quirks</h2>
<p>Every application has some quirks that may need extra explanation. So far,
there is really only one for MakerVR.</p>
<h3 id="copy-paste-undo-redo">Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo</h3>
<p>The interactions between copy and paste operations, coupled with undo and redo,
are generally intuitive, but may require some explanation. Here are the basic
rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying a model to the clipboard creates a clone of the model, meaning that
  any changes to the original model will not affect the copy.</li>
<li>Pasting a model from the clipboard also creates a clone, so that changes to
  the pasted model will not affect the model in the clipboard or any other
  models created by pasting it at other times.</li>
<li>Pasted clones will have the same name as the original model in the clipboard,
  but with a letter appended to it after an underscore (such as <code>"Box_1_A"</code>).</li>
<li>Undoing and redoing a paste operation always pastes the exact models that
  were pasted the first time.</li>
<li>Undoing and redoing any commands have no effect on the contents of the
  clipboard. Note that you can use this feature to your advantage if you want
  to undo back to an earlier state but still have another model available to
  paste into the scene.</li>
